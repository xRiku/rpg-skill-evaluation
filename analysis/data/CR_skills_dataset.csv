You left on the pathway to the dwarven citadel of Kraghammer. You were ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian Goliaths. Of which, partway through the battle, Grog managed to recognize one of them as a previous ally. And no longer an ally at this time. Son of a bitch.

Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here, I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture. We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one has explained the rules to your city.

Perception,"And it's a completely wrong direction, so it takes you a good two hours to eventually find your way to House Thunderbrand. When you get there, it's a beautiful, beautiful alabaster building. Large, white dome, with small spires built in to one of the more elevated ceilings of Kraghammer proper. You can see on the outside, there is no gate, just an open lawn. You see grass, you see what looks like normally outside flora and fauna currently adorning the scape around this structure. Woah.

I understand that, and I am sorry for losing my temper. But I was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts I have been looking for and this house is the only known arcane house I know that I was pointed to. I tried to reach them and communicate but I was stopped by the stupid rune I can't figure out! So I was turning back to get my tavern to get some rest and, you know, come back and try to contact the family the next day! And then I was stopped by you!",Matt: Make a persuasion check.

Is it sealed? Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed? You look at it. It does not have any sort of port or exit on it. It is just a solid barrel. Maybe, we can save some for them. Oh, okay. Here's the thing. If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right? Ah, that's right. So, maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside. And we'll give it to you later.",Matt: Make a persuasion check for that.
Stealth,"What are you doing, Scanlan?! What are you doing?! I don't know! Give me twenty minutes! Twenty minutes, that's okay, let's all step away from the house. Ask if he needs assistance or divergent - Divergent? Divergent. So, Margrim, of course, wipes his hands and walks away going: Ah, fucking foreigners. I follow him where he's going. Okay.

He points out to you as you approach, there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework that surrounds the exterior of the lawn. Those things! Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area.",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Nature,"stonework's pretty solid. Cool! Hey, it's a house. Yeah. There are dwarves around. No. Good. As you look about, it's hard to tell the nature. This looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior. Cool. But there's no fence. There's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check

Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?",MATT: No nature check required.
Arcana,"Pull it out. What? Pull out the flying-- Phrasing. Going for the handbook. Yeah, so we know what's going on. Oh, the magic carpet, hold on. Guys, don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry. Oh yeah! Oh, and I cast it at my fourth level slot. You wanna fly it up to the door? What are you casting? Dispel magic.","MATT: All right, make an arcana check."
Persuasion,"where we have to go slaughter a bunch of nasties in apparently one of your mines. And we don't know the source. And it appears to be of an extreme arcane nature of the dark sense, and I figured we could come to you for help and some kind of guidance. And I will-- Scanlan, will you stop it! And it appears that you very well know something that we could learn from, with all due respect, of course.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"""Ah, how nice to meet you. ""Where are you from?"" (bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello. (group laughs) Oh, shit. (Liam speaks in Swedish-accented gibberish) Ya, from Sweden. I'm gonna choke on a chip. (coughs) Keyleth is not good at this. Roll with it player, roll with it. I hail from the mountains up north. She had an accident on the way over here. We were hoping maybe--",MATT: Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage.
Persuasion,"have the best of intentions, and when it counts, we're there. We just need a little bit of help going into the mines. And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us, so please excuse my-- Cornwall? --challenged friends. My cornhole friends. We're here to help. I promise. That's a very Disney moment. Wink, wink, wink. I wink twice.",Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.

We'll very much like to perhaps make a deal with you, that we'll bring you objects of arcane nature for a discount on your wares.",MATT: Make a persuasion roll.
Arcana,"You imagine whatever creatures were barreling through before, this is probably where they came through. All right. That's where we're going. Make an arcane check. Somebody with arcane.

Investigation,"What are you looking for? I'm looking for, you know. (group laughs) Be specific. 15 arcana check. Scratch marks for anything. I like the idea of magic perception. I just wanna see if there's anything familiar about the markings, if I can identify any signs of something mystical that's come through here. Like a portal or a prison or a--",MATT: That'd be more of an investigation roll.
Investigation,"guys hit the bottom floor. You step off the platform, and you can see there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator that curves to the left and leads deeper into the mine proper. To the right of you is the spiral staircase. And you can see now two of the other miner dwarves are dragging a dead body across. Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those? (laughs) You can attempt",another investigation check.
Stealth,"This tunnel goes extremely deep. Whatever managed to dig its way up here came from pretty far under this mine. At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved? Nope, no change in physicality. No sign of struggle. But there are the drag marks all the way? Yeah. And two hours ago, I started stealthing and taking the lead. When we're in the dark. All right, go ahead",and roll a stealth check.
Perception,"Giant stalagmites and stalactites that just permeate the entirety of this cavern, which has been long, just building and building with elements drawn from the ceiling, from the waters that flow through. You also faintly see a light source-- (whispers) Oh no. --behind one of those rock pillars in the distance. (whispers) Should we go check it out? Do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in, yes?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Can you not see now? We can see in dim light. Cave bears have darkvision. I'm pretty sure. No, dim light only. Do they? What'd you turn into? It doesn't matter, do you want me to turn it back on? A cave bear. Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision. All right. So. He can just make light again.",MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Arcana,"On Grog? Okay. I don't think it's magic. Yeah, he's being controlled by it. He can do whatever. It's more natural, it's creature-based. She's also being controlled. I know, but you're a big, hulking, crazy mofo. No, it is a magical force. Yes, it is. Forced to make a save. Save me, save me.",MATT: Go head and make an arcana check.
Athletics,"You should be a rhinoceros. We're just waiting for you to scream, ""It's morphin time!"" It's morphing time! Bear! Oh my god, can you make me smoke bombs that smoke, and I say, ""It's morphin time""? So you can make a grapple attempt in place of one of your attacks. Okay. That's what I want to do. All right. So I just strength check then?",MATT: So it is an athletics check.
Athletics,"It's a waterfall, oh. (imitates thudding) You both plunge underneath the water's surface. Take a big old breath right beforehand, and I'm going underwater. Wait, can you let him go and let him drown? Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall. No, I'm holding on to him. But Keyleth, there's a waterfall. It's fine. It's now its turn. It's going to try and break your grapple.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Acrobatics,"(laughs) That's an attack. It's the world's easiest grapple throw. You threw him forever. Then I'm good. That's it? Well, that's my action, right? Correct. And I only have one. You can move, you can move. All right, so then, I'll hop through, through Percy and my sister. And run up behind the shithead who's fucking with Keyleth.","MATT: Make an acrobatics check,"
Stealth,"Cause that's as far as you can move currently. Actually you can move two more. Can I see anything from that point? All you see is Grog over there. They're covered and he's around the bend, so I'd run in further. All right, I'll run in further. Can I run in and stealth or is that it? Uh, you can attempt to. I'm gonna try to stealth as I'm going in. You're at disadvantage","on the stealth roll,"
Intimidation,"That's enough. As the arrow (imitates arrow flying), careens off, slams into the chest. (groans) It catches itself, steps back, and plummets off the side of the cliff onto the lower floor about 20 feet down. Smack, onto the ground. And I ask Scanlan to dispel the stank cloud. Dispel the stank. And I yell-- Can I yell out ""surrender"" in Undercommon? You yell out, (speaks angry gibberish)! (Laura speaks angry gibberish)",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Investigation,"-- and slap him on the face a few times. You slap him. Nothing. You slap him. Nothing. You slap him. No response. Someone, quick! Draw a dick on his face! I also bend down and slap him a few times. (all laugh) And then I say, I knew it wouldn't work. I just-- Dammit, Grog! I'm going to actually try a crude medical examination to see if I can--","SAM: Ooh, investigation check?"
Intimidation,"the wounds. There's more than one way to make someone talk! Ugh. I'm going to shoot my gun off-- get it nice and hot right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds. Okay so (gunshot). And the flash goes off. The sound of blast echoes throughout the entirety of the cavern. You can hear (echoing gunshot) cascade off. A little warning next time!

I drag her to her feet. Walk her over to the edge of the cliff where the water is, and hold Now's her last chance to give us anything useful to lead to her boss, I guess. All right. It's your last chance. Give us something useful? And we'll end this painlessly. Don't, and we'll make you suffer.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.

Okay, still 14. Still 14. I should've rolled my other one. To see. Just to see. She laughs and says: ""Your friend's dead! All is lost! You came for nothing!"" Can I tell if she's lying?

Religion,"Yes. You head back. Keyleth-- Terrible taxidermy attempt. -- as you are taking first watch, you notice that the campsite that the duergar were using, where you guys are currently resting for the evening, it's been there for a while and it looks like the duergar have repurposed it. The fire-- the stones that were set up around the actual fire pit have probably been there for quite some time, and were set up very uniformly and very well placed. Right above you, on one of the stone walls, you see what appears to be a strange, very well carved symbol. Hard to recognize it. Go ahead",and make a religion check.
Stealth,"as you move forward and the light begins to open up, you can see small pockets of that red stone that's used to light a bunch of Kraghammer. You can start seeing elements of it embedded in the walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving this reddish glow and the outline of some shapes. You begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet ahead of what looks like a series of huts, small stone structures cobbled together with small stone and stacked on each other. Simple driftwood and broken pieces of scavenged material put into small buildings. It's a very kinda ramshackle village underground. Let's burn it down.",LIAM: I am stealthing. I roll stealth.
Investigation,"A straight up with a big ol'-- I think it's like 500 feet. 500 feet is the maximum length. So. You guys approach slowly, the light source opens up, and you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn about the open area of this village. You can see there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into some of these huts in the sides that aren't goblin. You can see what looks like a few small dwarven bodies piled up on the side. As you kinda glance over you look, some of them are partially eaten like they have been stripped for meat. Ew. What?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"Magical. It's fine. I cast Prestidigitation and clean it all up. I take it. Okay, so you shake off the element-- All the goo. -- the remaining elements of the dwarven corpse. Just falls off out of the armor. You have to kind of shake it and eventually all of it escapes-- Yes. Thank you! Dwarven corpse. It's like pulled pork. Mm.",MATT: Make an arcana check. It does have a magical
Stealth,"You guys keep pushing forward. Is that what we're going to do? All right. All right, as you begin to press through the goblin ghost town-- We've got to get it closer than that. I'm still tracking, looking for anything interesting. Which you do, you catch, off in the distance, another faint moving light source. Oh shit! Hey, everybody, calm down. Huh? Sh! There's something moving in the distance.",MATT: Everyone roll a stealth check.

Stealth,"difficulty. Yay, bell curve. So you seem to be comfortable in the stillness of the moment. Best you can see in the distance, you see figures shifting, moving away from you. (whispers) Sh, figures! Many figures. A fairly large group of seeming to be humanoid figures, moving steadily away from you. Can we scout ahead? We're both really super stealth, can we like-- Yeah, we're gonna start kinda quickly dash after them.","MATT: Yeah, using your same stealth rolls, you"
Perception,"12. 12 I count. From what you can see it looks about 12-ish And they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them? They do, it's a very faint light. It's like a small cluster of the red stone that's been mined and put into a spherical element and is hanging from a chain like a lantern. We have two options. We can fight them. We could fight now. Or follow them. Follow. I think we follow them. Do I see any-- are there any bats?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"It's about the right size. Shotgun. The carpet begins to lift off, and you kind of will it towards-- Are you going straight over the bridge or are you taking a side route? We're going next to the bridge. Side and up. 'Cause they can look sideways. I think we should go down below the bridge. If you're on a bridge, you're looking down at your feet. Let's go above them.

And they're all just sitting on the outskirts of this platform. White eyes? All the duergar seem to have that natural look to their eyes as well. Shit. Okay. As the party you've been following enters the center of this vicinity,","make another stealth check, with advantage."
Stealth,"walk out, carrying cudgels at their side, still dripping with fresh blood. They kind of go amongst their own business from there. Okay. I think I'll go back to my fellows. There's nothing I can see-- that door doesn't lock-- does it lock by any chance? It's just an opening tent. Open tent. There's nothing lying around, none of that black armor lying around or anything?

Acrobatics,"(all groan) It's Christmas! Grog is running into Toys R Us. This is going to be great. You see gently as he backs away there is someone on this rack-like table. The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready. I use my bonus action to say, “You are so fucked, dwarf.” (all laugh) All right, that brings us to Tiberius. I like where this is going, Vax. Wait, I go over there first and then I say that. (all laugh)",MATT: Acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"Um, it was... Oh, go ahead, do something else. At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh. Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard. You're not trying hard enough, damn it! Fuck you man, all right? I'm having a tough day. You hear a little dwarf in the corner go: ""Mommy?"" Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid. I’m having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink. Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through. So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth and I come out around the corner.",MATT: Make an Acrobatics check.
Athletics,"1d8 inspiration dice. You don't kill him in one shot, it's very very disappointing. All right, you run in. You said the room was full of shiny pointy things on the wall, right? Yes. I would like to bull rush the dwarf up and against the wall, try and spear him with all the sharp shit on the wall. Okay! (cheering) Oh, that's nasty. Okay then, so for the-- (laughs) Instant karma's going to get you, man.","MATT: All right, so go ahead and make an athletics check."
Insight,"where you can go ahead and release the tension and eventually the chains go a little more slack and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath and looks about the room a second, looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze there's this constant anger and she looks down and goes: “So? Are you gonna let me go? “Come on! Release these chains!” Who is she? Wait, wait. Find out who she is first. Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she-- You can indeed.",This is an insight check.
Arcana,"can make it in here. I'm gonna take a peek at her. What do I do? What do I roll? Insight to see if she's in her right mind. 15? 18 is better. At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever this woman is, she's been here a while and has been subjected to many, many horrible things and still has that spark of life to her, mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain, but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive or trying to deceive you  just trying to get out of these fucking chains.

Persuasion,"(shouting) “Lady Kima!” And I blow fire breath. And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords around me with fire. Don't threaten Kima! She's better. (harshly) I give you my word. Her attention divided from Clarota, now tends towards you. Don't act me a fool, and don't treat me like one either! None of us are half-wits as you are claiming. We would not be fooled by such a creature like this. The words he speaks are true. And we believe him. You go ahead and make a diplomacy check.",Or a persuasion. Persuasion check.
Persuasion,"then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you. (gasps) What? We're giving you one last chance. Either you are with us, or you are against us. This is a threat. “So you walk in here, save me from my binds, “under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Allura--” We mean you no ill will. It is you who are aggravating the situation. You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep. So she stormed up. We're following her, right? You've followed her back into the base floor of the Emberhold itself. You all currently are now back kinda where you started after you snuck into the side passage of the Emberhold. And she said she would lead the way to the vault? Can we be quiet for a second and see if there's any footsteps around us or guards marching around? Are we in immediate peril or do we have a second? Certainly. Everyone go ahead and make an",immediate perception roll.
Perception,"second! Now this hallway, there appears to be an opening to this room, no doorway. Everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip. And this additional room, you do not currently see an entrance. An opening that's not a doorway? Or-- I mean, there isn't a door in the way, it's just an opening. The door is open. All right, so I'm going to press against the wall, up to the edge, wait for five seconds, see if I can hear anything, and then if not, curve around and peek in.",MATT: Perception roll.
Stealth,"can maybe try, what, 15 feet? Okay. And where are you casting it? Just in the middle of this hallway here? No. To my left. Here? He wants to see in the dark place. I wanna see in the dark place. There is no entrance to this room currently from what you can see. It's just a wall. There is a door on the opposite side. Now it's a well-lit wall. Hm. All right, well, I follow after the bear. (laughter)","MATT: All right, so what was your stealth roll?"
Stealth,"the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you reach around and just take your dagger and swing it across the back of his neck area. You manage to sever the base of the spine and he just crumples into a pile in front of you. The other one-- Damage? 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13. Both arrows impact his chest. The duergar steps back for a second, surprised by the moment, looks really furious and begins to step forward, his size enlarging. I knock him right in the face with the butt of my gun as he rounds the corner.",MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a stealth check

Perception,"syllables. (laughter) All right, so. Coasting down this hallway. It leads down to an open doorway and a closed doorway immediately to your right. And then the room to-- actually, the doorway's to your left, and to the right you see another wall to another room that you don't have a doorway currently available. There's a door to my left and a door straight ahead, right? Correct. Okay, I inch up to the closed door on the left and place my ear to the door and listen.","MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check."
Perception,"stone doors of the front of the fortress. To your left, there is a double wooden door, about eight feet tall each side, about five feet wide, that are currently closed, leading into whatever this large chamber is immediately to your left. Can I hang a right and go down that other hall? We should check out what's in that other hall. Is there a door over there? There are two doors, actually. Closed? Both closed. I'm going to listen into those doors.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"And since Tiberius is there, I can get sneak attack damage, 'cause one of my allies is there-- All right, just a second there, you're still holding, let's finish Keyleth. So Keyleth, what are you doing? Well, is Grog in my way? Grog is there. You can attempt to leap over Grog. I was wanting to vault off Grog's back, is what I was wanting to do. You can do that without asking him. Yeah, that's what I was going to do. No, you were saying you wanted to tell Grog you were going to do that. But yes, you can still",do it. So go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
Athletics,"and with a giant arc through the air that lights up that portion of the room with a brief sweep, the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit. Second attack also hits. Yes, go Kima. So that comes to-- okay, using her Divine Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal 37 points of damage to it. Damn. As she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously. The mindflayer, however, does not release its grasp on you. You are still considered grappled. That ends her turn. Grog now is gonna angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna","make an-- actually no, no athletics check, he's"
Athletics,"(laughter) All right, that puts a total of 32 points of damage, that's enough. So Grog just takes two big swings. The first one comes through, cracks the door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears back a second time, cleaves through the door entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges, he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side completely open to the interior. He then moves in around Clarota. That's as far as he can get in this current turn. That brings us to Vax. What can I do while grappled, nothing until I'm ungrappled? Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics",or athletics roll against them
Perception,"staircase. Up or down? Looks like it's going up. And what's in this room? I'm looking over here. Okay, you look over here. It's a double door that is currently closed. I will head in your direction as well. Eight, two of my d6s to heal up. You haven't taken a short rest yet. You have to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes, 15 minutes to rest to do that, so-- I'm gonna look all over the great hall and see if there's any cool stuff in there.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"get us out of this area specifically. So you guys are all moving back with-- Is that cool? -- Vex to return to the previous storage room? We can do that. Yeah, go for it. And you'll hear us if anything goes wrong. Yeah, we'll power through it. Use your earring. All right. I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check
Perception,"You open the doors into what appears to be a large temple chamber, a place of worship. What you see are a series of long, wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center. There is an altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you can't see from this distance. In the center of the room there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a giant warhammer and a shield. Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger.

There's some sort of religious artifacts over here. Could use your expertise. Pike, you make your way through, eventually coming down this hallway-- (clanking) She's coming! I can hear her coming. Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was coming? (laughter)",MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Stealth,"at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose. She got you a heart. I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room. Okay. I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to continue down to the end of the hall. This way? Yeah. Okay, you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the side of the fortress. I just walk all the way over to the corner, stealthing.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Arcana,"I would like to stealth through the door. Before I leave, I carefully examine that statue. Okay, what are you examining? The facial features of the god, the deity, right? Is that what he is? Yeah. Okay, so you look at the face of Laduguer. You can see it's very, very old, it's very well-crafted. You can see a lot of very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation. It almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and various other volcanic activity-based mineral deposits.","ORION: I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to"

Yeah, you can start moving back this way. I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what I",see. Do I need a new stealth check or?
Perception,"head stealthily through the door and see what I see. Do I need a new stealth check or? Yes you do. Okay, great. So that is a 32. All right, you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room. There are-- most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures. You know, various shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry. There's what looks like a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff. Anything good-looking?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Intimidation,"Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you. You can see Kima coming into the room behind you guys. Steps over the broken table, down in front of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of his robe, pulling him into her face. The mage at this point is still kind of reeling from the fact that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts. He's just not a nice man. However, Kima, with a look of absolute death in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and says, ""Listen, where is the rest of your fucking army?""",She's going to make an intimidation check.
Investigation,"outside the front of his nose. The duergar being held up against the wall says, ""Whatever you haven't killed. The army's probably up with the king ""himself. They're all waiting for you and I hope they piss on your body when they're done!"" At which point she takes the blade and twists it. As she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes just go blank. Blanker than the duergar eyes normally are. I make it to the doorway and go, what is going on in here? Are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use?",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

There's a row of duergar around the corner, they're all in a line like Radio City, we just-- if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you, Keyleth?

Persuasion,"So the doors burst open and you guys come through. All of the duergar stand there with their weapons at the ready. You can see in the back, on this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready. You can see two kind of lizard-like creatures in the back on chained leashes.

There is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground, yes. I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava column and try and contain it within the Wind Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a tornado-like vortex around the lava. Okay.

I mean, you go over to it, and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can. The magma pulls close to you and you manage to just take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the room. It's spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber. I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now! We pick him up.",MATT: Both of you guys make an athletics check.

Some of them are starting to grab large rocks and fill in areas of the stronghold. Some of them you can see are robed individuals begin casting spells. You can see portions of other stone walls beginning to mount up and try and block the flow from the interior and exterior of Emberhold. However, you guys are still within eyesight, technically, of any duergar on that side of the fortress, so I'm going to ask everyone now to make",a stealth check. Those that are pulling the
Medicine,"I can use my beast sense  that is one more thing I can still do. I could theoretically-- We could use Trinket. We need to undo the stone that has taken over Tiberius and Kima. Do I have the necessary tools to synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood? You can certainly try. It's a very ramshackle set-up. You do not have an alchemical set, but you can certainly attempt to, using a small fire, a couple of your general smelting tools you use for your metal work. You could attempt to distill it down, but that would be a combination of a tinkering roll on your point,",followed up by somebody else's medicine roll to

Insight,"Before we go to sleep, I go over to Kima and I say to her, Lady Kima, I think we're all going to take a rest and you as well, correct? ""I think I should."" We can trust you while we're all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions, correct?

Nature,"of us? Essentially. I'm looking for signs of mining. Okay, go ahead and make an investigation check. I'm going to make an arcana check, also. 15. 15. Checking the walls immediately in your vicinity, you see there are signs of mining, but they're old, they haven't been used in a while. You can see some veins that are dried up. Looks like maybe the duergar had business down here mining. Does it look like there-- Can I do a",nature check to see if this is an old lake bed?
Perception,"Okay, so there appears to be-- are there any whole pieces of bones? Big femurs or skulls? This was some sort of burial ground. It's hard to see. Most of the bones that have been here, have been around long enough to the point where they've eroded, been broken, destroyed over and over again to the point where you can't discern any of the original creatures they may have come from. It's just a sea of bone, obsidian glass, and small bits of stone that have fallen from the actual nearby cavern. Can we see any sort of civilized construction here? Or is this all the work of nature or some living thing?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Athletics,"and he just starts trying to wrestle himself free. This blur of motion jumps off one of the platforms, spins in the air, and lands with a slam that completely splatters across the rock that he's right next to. This duergar, you can see part of his jaw go flying off to the side and silence hits him in the middle of his scream. The last duergar there, you can see who's looking around, sees the stone platform, and goes, ""Let me ""on! Let me on!"" He goes running over and is trying to jump up towards the stone platform you guys are on. How much does he weigh? (giggles) Well, he's going to go ahead and try and",grab it with an athletics check-- he makes it!
Acrobatics,"Like over where? Yeah, there's good. Shit, can't cast any spells unless I land. I'm going to have to drop down. Can I perch on one of these stalactites? You can, but you're going to have to let go of the gnomes to do so. Do it. Can I drop off you guys? Yep. You hear (bird noises). What? And I drop them off really quick. What did she say? All right, so both of you guys make",acrobatics checks. Disadvantage for you because of

All I see is mountains. Oh, I see, you put the yellow ring around him? And Kima's to the right of him? Kima's being held by him. Oh, okay. Great. I look at him, see what's going on. I (ping) my Ioun Stone, and I conjure out Telekinesis from it, and I guide it towards the monster's tentacle to unwrap it off Kima, and I attempt to pull it off her.",MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Athletics,"You see where part of it seems to start and open, but it's starting to close up again. You reopen that seam and drag across, leaving a giant wound across its side. Okay, and then with that knife in, I'm going to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack it and then drag it to the ground. Grapple it to the ground with my body as I attack. Second attack is a 25. 25 hits. Okay. That's seven. Are you doing damage, or you grappling him? I'll grapple. Okay, so there's no damage on this. Go ahead",and make an athletics check.
Athletics,"Yes! Okay! As you finish casting the spell and shouting at her, you look down and notice the ground. (swish, shoosh) Begins pulling you down No, I'm still on the stalactites. I haven't moved off the stalactite! I'm straddling it. A little straddle action! I'm riding that stalactite Go ahead. Riding it side-saddle. It's really hard to be on top of that and cast spells and talk about this. (chuckling) It's a giant piece. I'm going to say, go ahead and make",an athletics check.
Athletics,"an athletics check. All right. Ooh! 24. Okay! You manage to precariously stay on the top of this stalactite, holding on to it, casting spells and shouting out. All right. Jeez, Kima! Stop! This is hard already! Percy! I'm going to crawl and find myself a seat on top of that stalactite. That's my first thing I'm going to do. Okay, well, at the start of your turn, make a dexterity check. 20! All right. You manage to pull out. Now make",an athletics check to try and make your way up to
Acrobatics,"Sorry, Vax! That brings us to the top of it now. It's still alive? It's still alive?! It's got that healing factor. Can we undo its healing factor? After all the impact, all the sounds it's hearing, it moves over to this vicinity. Ain't he grappled? Oh, you're holding it here. I'm holding it. It's going to attempt to break from your grapple. Good luck.",MATT: So you make an acrobatics check.
Athletics,"Okay. Trinket can, yeah, if you want. Can he try to climb up and get away from it? Oh, no. He'll take a hit, won't he. He will. Do it. If it hits. It could miss. Oh god, but he's so low on health. Where's he at? He's right next to it! Get up, Trinket, get up on the wall. And I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the thing. What's the radius on Hail of Thorns? Five feet. Five feet. Okay. Trinket is going to attempt",to get up the wall. Make an athletics check for

You can see parts of its flesh trying to reach up and re-form, and then starting falling limp as its form begins to quiver and eventually fall apart. The seams all begin to unravel and its entire body begins to fall apart into chunks. Eventually what's left is this elven torso that slinks to its knees (boof), takes a step,takes another step, and then falls onto its back, completely destroyed. The bones begin to reach up and take its body. Trinket is still currently being held aloft. I see what's going on. I cast Telekinesis (fssh) and start pulling it up.","MATT: Okay, make an arcana check. You have"

As you are, they just disintegrate and turn into dust. It's leaving a track. A little bit of a groove in the ground as you do so. Follow me! Follow the track!

Arcana,"arms inside the torso that were pushed inside to attach this entity. Can we-- Can you what? Go ahead. Sorry. You can see a couple of fingers poking out of each side. Should we take the body? Do we see any ligatures? Is there sewing? Or has it been stitched together? The tentacles were stitched to it, and you can't see any actual stitches, like it's this weird thing where it's actually bonded to it, but it looks like some sort of strange--","ORION: I'll do an arcana check on that, and I"
Arcana,"are attached to a wrist. You pull a little bit, and with this horrible sickening (fssht) sound you manage to pull an arm out from inside the torso, covered in its own blood and fluids. Prestidigitation! Clean that up. You clean it off. The magical essence you were seeing earlier actually is coming from a set of metallic bracers that are on the wrists. Take them! I take them. Okay. Don't put them on, though. Don't put them on. I'll inspect them. They're cursed.",MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.
Survival,"across this open field of bone and glass to the other side, finding for the first time in a little bit of time solid stone ground. You all take a moment and gather your breath, and as you're taking a moment, you look over and you can see in the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint source of light around another large pillar or cluster of stone in the distance. Is it a color? Do I see any tracks around? It's reddish-orange and appears to have a flicker to it. Do I see tracks? Can I sense goliath tracks?",MATT: Go ahead and roll a survival check.
Stealth,"Actually, let me tell you all that Grog is up here, you didn't know. I assumed you'd come back by now. No, I'm still up there. That raises the stakes! (all laugh) Last week I said, ""Come up now."" And that's when he called it. And I had already taken off. So I'm already headed there. All right. Well, he's at least said, ""Come up now."" So we're... we're there.","MATT: So Tiberius, roll a stealth check."

I see what's going on and I rub my ring and I go invisible. Okay. Greater Invisibility. All right, so. Tiberius also vanishes from view. You glance over your shoulder, Vax, and notice that Tiberius is just gone. Just (whoosh) vanished. All right. So. As you shouted this out, the secondary duergar now turns and... First off,","make a persuasion check. Well, no, in this case"

My friends and I have come-- Hello! Hi, yes... We've come from the above world. The normal world, let's say, to your fine kingdom down here below. And we were on a mission. We're a bit of-- I don't want to brag, but we're a bit of an elite task force, sent in by kingdoms and kings that you probably haven't heard of way down below, but anyway. I'll spare you.

Stealth,"We'll get to that in a second. Vex. Vax, sorry. Okay, I'm going to use my feat, Cunning Action, for one extra action per turn of combat, use for either dash, disengage, or hide. So I'm going to double distance and go one... two... three, four, five-- I still can't see her-- six, maybe... seven, eight, nine, ten. Stop right here by Clarota.

Investigation,"past. It is a potion of greater healing. Yeah, and we haven't used the yellow potion yet. And nobody ever drank that? No. There is another potion that has almost a blue, frosty color to it as you take the vial from where it sits in the rest. The actual glass that contains the liquid has a layer of frost crystals around it. I'm going to remember that you're the one who suggests drinking random, yellow liquids and I'm going to bring you a vial of yellow liquid. I'm just saying.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"sorry, Grog,"" goes over and places her hands upon you. As she's about to, Kima pushes her aside, and says, ""I've got this."" Walks up, and you can see this divine glowing energy. It fills her hands. She reaches out and touches you and this warmth fills-- this warmth fills your torso. Using her Lay On Hands ability, Lady Kima of Vord heals you for 38 points of damage. Did I find anything on the other people? Thank you, Kima. You look through the bodies. It looks like most of their adornments, other than the natural armor and weapons they have, nothing of particular",interest. Make an investigation check.
History,"Well, the bottom line is, (sighs) we have a pretty clear goal at hand. Everything else will have to be figured out afterward. I still follow Clarota.

Nature,"(laughs) You reach out and touch the crystal, and it's cold to the touch, as is most of the stone wall, and you can see there's condensation on it that gets on your fingers a bit. It's smooth, except for the jagged points where the natural formation juts out. You tug on the crystal a little bit, find if there's any place there that's moveable, and it's pretty solid in that rock wall. Does it appear to be producing cold?

Perception,"You can. The passage is very, very thin. It can maybe fit you individually. It can barely fit Grog when you actually go through the passage proper. It's pretty spacious in here, I think. (all laugh) For a gnome, yes. But yeah, it's pitch black going forward. Which means you guys can see. It's equivalent of low light for you in pitch darkness. About 30 feet ahead of you, you can see the path continues for a little bit and then widens up into what looks like a small chamber. But you'd have to get closer. Is it dangerous at all?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Stealth,"I pick up the bomb, and I start guiding it into the cave. Is it so hard to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave? It's already in! Pay attention, ranger. So the bomb that was constructed ages ago by Percy that was originally intended to put on a summoned pony. Yes. Never got to use it. But now is finally being used. Tiberius, you approach the edge of the cavern.",Make a stealth check.

Yes. Never got to use it. But now is finally being used. Tiberius, you approach the edge of the cavern. Make a stealth check. How do we light it? He'll light it. A what check?",LAURA: A stealth check.
Perception,"with some gaping half-bodies of these creatures torn open from the explosion. There is nothing living and nothing moving from what you can see at the center of this cavern. Let's go in! The occasional (dripping sounds) chunks dripping off the ceiling. Excellent. Is the magic dispelled? For sure? Take a couple steps in, and perception.",MATT: Perception check.
Arcana,"where they do that to keep fed. However, this tunnel appears to be empty other than the strange phenomenon of this energy in the tunnel. I feel we should camp here for the night. No more magic? Or day, whenever the heck. Is there anything that can come through the portal? It's more just an energy shield. Before we plan something, is there a portal or something?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Stealth,"I'm going to take the boat. I've got a big axe. I'll paddle the boat towards the island. Awesome. I've been practicing in the sand to impress Keyleth. Working on the elevator. I haven't figured it out yet, because I don't know what that is. You know that thing a dog does when it pulls its butt along the floor? But I could cast Pass Without a Trace so everybody gets +10",to their stealth rolls.
Athletics,"All right, so you take a little bit of your thick, heavy leather thread, the stuff that you use for something, and you loosely attach it to the bottom of the carpet. Sorry, I did a quick scrying spell and I know that we're 50 shirts away from the total, so keep going. Get your mother a shirt. Keep going. Okay, so we're over the water? Yeah, we're already paddling. The boat's going too. We're fucking fast. So, as Grog's pulling along--","make an athletics check, by the way."
Stealth,"Okay, so we're over the water? Yeah, we're already paddling. The boat's going too. We're fucking fast. So, as Grog's pulling along-- make an athletics check, by the way. Oh yeah, about to smash you. And we're stealthing? Ahead? You guys are-- Being sneaky. It's a 22. All right, so. You pull it across. It's a slow speed, but you're making your way. I would also like Grog",to make a stealth check.
Nature,"I will not forget that. Very rude. All right. Can we go inspect those structures up there? Yes, everyone wait here. I grab Scanlan by the scruff of the neck and nod at my sister. I turn invisible. Let's go take a peek, yes? We'll take a peek. Just wait a minute. We can wait. That's fine. I actually go collect a few of the vines hanging from the trees.

It's quite a ways up. It's up the side of the cliff. It's up an incline, and the forest starts adjacent to the structure where they're going. Might want to wait.",MATT: So you can make a stealth check
Stealth,"No, I'll wait. I thought we were next to a tree. No, most of the forest starts further up this incline as the island itself begins to level off. Let the scouts scout. Let's go scout it out. All right. So we make our way up to the structure. 28 for stealth. 28 for stealth. You get advantage on your roll.",LAURA: Is it our old stealth check?

Oh, should we hide? Can we try to hide? All of you were stealthed as well. Oh, yeah. Can I do insight and see if it seems like a bad guy?",MATT: You can make an insight check.
Insight,"""I've been the SHITs."" (all laugh) Someone asked if the group would ever do Hot Pepper Gaming. (laugh) There are plans in place for most of us to partake. I don't know if everyone will, but some will. Again. Quite a few. Yeah, so that will be fun. Someone is asking what Matt whispered to me",when I insight-checked Marisha.
Medicine,"And I look at everyone here as a second family. Oh, Liam. We love you. I'm going to make a Liam plushie. Yeah, man. Love this guy here. Look at all the hearts. Oh, yeah, we've got to go on Honesty Hour now. Give them the whole shebang. Ride the feels. Has Pike tried healing? (laughs)",LAURA: It's a medicine roll
Stealth,"These are dried apricots. Those are huge! I'm just saying it's a shame, because he's right in the thick of this sequence here. So, as the party was making their way up the shore, they found bits of the ruins that coat the entirety of the subterranean city. They found what looked like some sort of a large stone, partially crumbled fighting pit. And what looked-- As Vex, Vax, and Scanlan were stealthing over, Scanlan himself invisible, had stealthed over to scout ahead, managed to find what looked like an encampment of some kind. A series of rags and furs. A very large living space for some sort of creature. Scanlan,","failing his stealth roll, seemed to draw the"
Acrobatics,"There are chunks of ruined buildings in the vicinity, probably a good 30, 40 feet from where you are. You guys are right along the edge. I think we should duck and hide under his covers. His big, nasty fur bed. All right. (booming footsteps) I go! Okay, stealthing away. Okay, so the two of you leap off the edge of this, down into his living, bedding area. Should I grab Scanlan and pull him in? No. The two of you leap off, down. Both make an",acrobatics check.
Stealth,"Oh! So he's really small. He's a tiny guy, tiny guy. Yeah, he's like Rudy. Should we capture him, or should we just-- Scanlan goes, ""You, wha--"" Capture him, capture him! ""You told me to do something!"" You guys aren't there! I don't think you know how big he is-- Scanlan would say, ""Capture him!"" I know, that's what we're working through. Vax just backs back into the shadows, hoping the giant forgets about him. Thanks, vomit-y brother.",MATT: Stealth check.
Acrobatics,"him. Okay. So you leap off the side. As you leap in the air, he glances over with his large eye and does a backswing with the club in mid-air, trying to basically baseball-swing you. Oh, he'll hit me. We'll find out. That is an 18? Oh yeah. Okay. You take 19 points of bludgeoning damage. As he (impact sound). Tee-balls you. Really. Like, backhand swing hits you.

Acrobatics,"You may. (bad flute playing) I don't know, can you? (slightly less bad flute playing) There you go. Yeah, some Jethro Tull up in here. (sings) You got the touch! You got the power!

Anybody can-- Yeah, yeah. Would you like to join us? Whose turn is next? Grog. Next after this is Vax. You're just appealing to his reason? Can I go next? And help him out?

I have poison. I have drow poison from a previous adventure. That's a knockout drug, isn't it? You don't know much about drow poison. Damn it!",MATT: Go ahead and make a nature roll.
Perception,"Let me sleep, hold on. It is probably the nicest thing this creature has ever worn. Just keep that in mind. There's a pair of pants hanging off his eye. You finish restraining him with the chains. Who's doing what? She's just casting, right? I guess you can help me out? I'm going to inspire her, somehow. I'm going to encourage success. I'm going to inspire her with a song. I'm going to see if I see anything more than just spikes down in the hole.",MATT: Perception check.
Arcana,"out and it's an intricate gold and bronze javelin. You found booty? Pull me up. Well, I can't use this. What is it? It's a javelin. It's beautiful. Will you inspect it? Beautiful things should go to Pike, I think. Oh, Scanlan, but she has really good aim. She doesn't really throw sharp, pointy things. This would be good for you, big guy. I just feel that the gold of the javelin would match the gold of your heart. Oh, Scanlan!",ORION: I'm going to inspect it. Arcana check. 23.

I'm just wondering what more you're going to find out from a flyby that I couldn't find out from my vision.

That's even more silly.",LAURA: Because all his stealth checks lately have

Stealth,"And, we'll say Clarota will go with you guys because Clarota can stealth. Kima will stay back. I cast Pass Without a Trace on the entire party, before we all take off. Good. All right. As you guys all continue forward. Let's see. Keyleth, are you going with them? No. I stay behind. All right. I'm going to, in front of us, using Minor Illusion, I'm just going to create a floating bald eagle thing to distract the bats with. Okay. It's just flying around.",MATT: Everyone on the carpet make a stealth check.
Stealth,"I'm staying on the carpet. So he's going back. And you're going back to pick up the others? And Grog slowly flies over and meets up with you guys. I thought you stayed back. No, I had to go with you so I could take the carpet back. There's enough room now, for the carpet to go back and take all of us? So I can come back with the carpet. Yeah. Because they're dropped off. Okay, so you dropped us off.",MATT: Did you roll a stealth check?
Perception,"Oh no. That's 19. Plus ten? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So, you guys are left at that point, now. I want to examine the structure to see if I could find the optimal place and the weaknesses in the structure. Whether or not it's more appropriate to pour the acid on the stone, whether it's better to pour the acid on the metal. Just to see where it would be weakest, mathematically.",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Persuasion,"How far away is it from me? About 60 feet. Don't do it. I turn, and I, seeing the bats come in, in bat language, in like, you know, echo (bat noises). The bats say, ""What are you clicking at us?"" Echolocation. I tell the bats, don't worry about it. Go home. Nothing to see here. Forget about it. Forget about it. We're running an errand for K'Varn. Don't worry about it.",MATT: Go make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"I cast Speak with Animals. That's what I cast. It was a spell. Oh! I did not hear that. I thought you were just trying to do that. (laughter) No, I said I do this. I cast Speak with Animals. I somehow missed that phrase or that never came up in the conversation. Anybody else hear Speak with Animals as a spell? I heard her say, ""I cast--"" I was looking at the page. Okay, I missed that. Okay, so. I think you said, ""I cast Talk to Bats.""","MATT: So, what was your persuasion roll, then?"
Stealth,"I have the mouse. Okay. So, I'm going to start by taking our normal vials of acid and I'm going to pour very gingerly right at the sections I want to crack and start letting it burn. While we're standing there, I pull out an arrow and I'm tying the little tiny mouse onto an arrow. And I also pull out my climbing equipment and my 200 feet of rope out of the Bag of Holding. All right. And start putting the climbing gear on.",MATT: All right. Make a stealth check.
Arcana,"You take-- No. Are there any jutting stone things, anywhere around? It's just flat? No, it's smooth, stone surface surrounding this glass top. Percy, as you've placed the acid around the two sides, you kind of slowly move around and trickled along where the metal beams reach the stone. The acid is having an effect, but it's a very slow-- Okay, I'm going to take the major bottle of acid, and I'm just going to-- Before he does, can I-- I'm going to just see if there's any magic protecting these-- the metal or the joints.",MATT: Arcana check.
Stealth,"But the actual metal material also balances the acid with a little bit. So essentially, you begin carving into it, but the little bit you use doesn't keep burning through it. Burns to a certain point, and then just loses its acidity. Okay, I'm going to keep gingerly slicing it through, until it's just being held. The minute it starts to give, I'm going to shift to the next one. You make your way about halfway through the vial before that one platform you feel is about halfway or more dissolved through. All right, I'm going to take the other half and I'm going to work on the other--",MATT: Stealth check.
Stealth,"carpet. Yeah, I know. He's right there, though. Flying next to us. And, the Endless Rope? As I'm asking for that, I take out my Immovable Rod and I'm going to place it, kind of, in an exit position and (clicks)! Make it stay right above there. All right. As he releases it, this rod is now stuck in mid-air, anchored permanently until removed by a click in that position. And I start flipping through the rope so it goes-- The whole time, I'm just doing that so it goes all the way down.","MATT: Okay, make a stealth check."
Investigation,"we won't have even gotten through-- But what if it doesn't bust all the way through until we start popping some of the beams? I don't-- I think dropping three tons on him is going have much more-- And even if it doesn't, it might be better than trying to crank it. It's a three-inch-thick piece of pane and steel. I'm going to do-- Would I have gotten enough engineering information about it to actually have a good sense on whether or not three to five tons would actually do anything at this point?",MATT: Investigation check.
Athletics,"A d10. That's a ten? That's a d10. Two. A 14. That's a 14? So, as you bring your shield up to defend, this strange kind of grayish-green ray slams into you and you feel weightless for a moment, as, all of a sudden, you're lifted off your feet and carried down into the chamber, floating, restrained. Unable to move. And you're just kind of floating in midair right there, right now. Okay. And then the beam releases you. Go ahead and",make an athletics check.
Athletics,"50 feet at an angle. (laughs) I'm gonna do it. Fuck it. What are you doing? YOLO. YOLO! I'm going to run off the carpet and I'm going to do a swan dive and-- She's not on the carpet. You're not on the carpet with Tiberius, you're on the edge of the platform. Tiberius is up here. I'm on the edge of the platform-- There you go. Running, and I'm going to swan dive, and as I swan dive--","MATT: Athletics check, first."
Athletics,"I'm going to grab about-- How high are we up? You are about 50 feet up right now. 50 feet, all right. I'm going to use my bonus action to get down to 25 feet and I'm going to jump-- But I'm going to jump out in the hopes of swinging this way, and swinging back towards K'Varn. (laughs) Pendulum. That's what I want to-- Pendulum at him, yeah. I want to jump out and go, woo, woo! Okay, so you grab the rope, leap out in that direction. Catching yourself at 25 feet. That's going to be your movement for this whole thing. So you reach up, you grab it. Go ahead and make an",athletics check.
Athletics,"way and the beam just (shhh) past you. Thank you, Keyleth. You're-- Yeah, totally. I don't know what I did, but you're welcome. As it hits part of the stone nearby you, wherever the beam hits the stone, the stone is just no longer there. It's like it just carved through it. What was this one? Very similar to what Queen Ulara did to the top of the throne room. Disintegrate. You could've been dead. As movement, K'Varn's going to try and break your grapple. Go ahead and make another athletics","check. Keyleth, athletics check."
Acrobatics,"It's not an attack, okay. Then a strength saving throw. With advantage. Oh, With advantage. Oh good. Ee. Not good. Ten. So a familiar beam streaks up, kind of a deep green color slams into you. And you feel yourself chucked off the top, restrained, and then pulled down with severe force into the center of the temple. Oh, into the room? But I don't want to be in there. And then the beam releases you. You go slamming into the ground. Go ahead and make an",acrobatics roll. You have advantage because of

Pike, you're up. You're currently (grunts). Can I heal if I'm still grappled? You can, yeah, you just can't move. You can break the grapple though, right? As a movement, you can break the grapple if you want to. I'm going try to break the grapple first, 'cause then I can--","MATT: Make an athletics check, with disadvantage"
Athletics,"going to go ahead and use an ability called Sacred Weapon. She pulls out the hammer and as she brings her hand across it, this divine flame begins to burn around the base of where she's holding it and the giant head of the maul. Badass. She steps forward to there. Actually, going to move to the side a little bit, there. That's going to be her turn. She shouts out, ""Someone bring it down!"" Brings to the top of the round. Grog and Keyleth. Oh, I'm getting a donut. Hang on. Okay. Fastball Special. Fastball Special. So, ""Gymnast, hyup!""","MATT: All right, athletics check. Actually, no."
Athletics,"Pretty freaking huge. I know. Not that high up. I would say, you go ahead and roll a strength check as well, as you're also pushing off of her. Fuck yes. 22. 22. Between him pushing off the force of your hands, you manage to move over, leap in the air approximately at his height. Before you plummet, what are you going to do? Horn. Horn. Horn! Yeah, I'm going to grab the black horn. All right. You reach out. Go ahead and make",an athletics check.
Perception,"19. Yeah. Damn. For a second, you feel like the force of K'Varn's mind begins to creep over yours, and you feel the urge to suddenly turn to his side. You shrug it off out of just the general fury and anger, realizing that you, wouldn't matter, being raging, are immune to charm effects. All right, that ends your turn. Tiberius? Still over here. As far as, down, as I could have been to begin with, so even-Steven with those guys. Yeah. What do I see in the town? Do I see a mass anywhere?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Persuasion,"About 30 feet from you. Great. You, over there! Quickly! And I get their attention. They all stop and look up at you. A look of confusion, as mind flayers both do not speak through language, let alone speak Common out loud. Look, I took the form of one of your own. Pretty much to get your attention. We need your help. We want to defeat the one who's taken control over your mind. We are the ones who disabled the crystal to begin with. Please come on this-- With me. We can go much faster. Up here, please!",MATT: You make a persuasion roll.
Athletics,"of his view. That brings it to K'Varn's turn. K'Varn is going to attempt to shrug you off the horn, Grog. Hold on! First it's going to fly up. Oh, great, yeah. That's good. It's going to fly up? I had to grab that thing. Can I move underneath so I can maybe catch Grog from where I cheerleader-- Unfortunately, right now, no. Why are you cheerleading somebody? Prep.

Athletics,"mark above her, a giant flash of divine energy, just kind of sparks in-- Is left behind her like a giant trail through the sky. She brings the hammer down towards K'Varn. That is a 21, that hits. As she slams into it, Kima-- Go ahead and throw-- Is going to go ahead and throw a 3rd-level spell into Divine Smite, doing an additional 3d8 damage on top of that. That'll be 38 points of divine damage. That's great. Slamming into the side, knocking teeth out. You can see, now, portions of the eye starting to swell. K'Varn's looking pretty rough. Kima, however, just continues to go and attempts to land--",Does not make the athletics check and takes--
Athletics,"It's very heavy? Yeah, so beat it in the face. I was going to try and bring it down on top of K'Varn. Kind of in the middle of a bunch of stuff. Yeah. The process of doing that will probably take out a few other people. Punch the eyeball. I'm then just going to run and just do a double strike. Well, you know what? I'm going to run in and just grapple him. I'm going to grapple him again. All right, go for it. Go ahead and make an",athletics check.

However, it gives you a range, so you as the GM or DM, you decide based on how powerful the item is, how much it's worth if the players wanted to sell it or buy it, and generally you consider if players are selling magical items, they're selling lower than they would buy it from, like any sort of pawn shop-type thing, they might get a quarter of what it's worth at a store, but if they're really charismatic and they're really good with",their persuasion rolls they might be able to get

However, you are, as you are a dwarf, you have dark vision, and in the low-light circumstance from the noonday sun, you are able to look down and see that the brackish liquid, what would be a normal watery well, instead is very thick and viscous in the way it slowly moves. And from what you can gather, the water is disturbed. Recently has been disturbed. Huh, that's good. Are there any shiny trinkets there, like there might be some coins in the bottom? Anything glittering through the thickness?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"I forgot me stumpy arms. With the aid of someone else, you could probably get in there if you want-- Would you be so kind as to dangle me? Oh yeah, you know I'll dangle you. It's a dwarf thing. So (laughs) as Ulfgar grabs you by the ankles and slams you over the front of the well, you dangle down, your fingers just reaching in towards the liquid. You grab at the coins. It's very, very cold, the liquid, but it warms quickly as a strange tingling sensation begins to rapidly encase your hand as the feeling begins to go numb. Your hand gathers a handful of coin, and I want",you to go ahead and make an athletics check.
Perception,"We speak Common. (laughter) What would it take to pick up the Snugglelord and dip his head, just the tip of his head-- Oh, what about the gold piece you just gave me? Yeah, just dip his head in, just a little bit. Listen, I want to find this chat room. Let's find where those scampering scabs got off to. All right.

Okay, so as you rush past, it swings out at you. That's gonna be a 14. I think you said your AC's 16? Yeah.

Only with dwarves. Persuasive... yeah, well, maybe there's some dwarves hanging about. There might be some dwarves! So how are you doing this? Okay, make a",persuasion roll.
Intimidation,"Dude. You've got to check your balanced dice, man. All right.

Herbalism is, sorry, that's old systems. I mean, I'm proficient in nature. We'll say nature, it'd be nature. I've run too many systems. Too many games. So we'll say, are you proficient in nature?

You can see the rest of the deckhands are up there now, with weapons ready, and are starting to fight some of these off. Can we use any kind of perception to see if the things on them are controlling them?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Nature,"that even in this low-light circumstance, there appear to be on three of these winged, dragon-like creatures smallish, humanoid entities that are on small, almost leather strapped saddles that are put on the sides of this creature. They're clutching onto it and each one is carrying some sort of large, spear-like weapon. There is a fourth one in the distance that does not appear to be dragonoid.

As you reach out, this gargantuan version of a Scanlan fist comes rocketing through the sky, the fingers unraveling, clutching the griffon.

I look up and I see that everyone's got that wyvern taken care of, and I turn my gaze back to that little halfling in front of Vex. I'd like to move to him, please. All right.

I would like to pick him up, not chuck him, but pick him up and hold him ever-so-gently over the side and say, My, my, it does seem like a long way down.

Perception,"dodge and leap out of the way, making your way across the room to where the staircase descends, out of the immediate danger. Ah. Jeez. The rest of you now are standing on the opposite side of this room, which is currently a rotating grinding mill. That was great. I'd like to check if there's any kind of device or anything on this side-- Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out for a minute. We all just took a little damage this last time.",LIAM: I'm just trying a perception check.

I'm just trying a perception check. He's checking. He's checking.","MATT: All right, make a perception check."
Stealth,"clicking. (groaning) I stealth immediately. Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here. Oh, yeah, that would be good! Do you want to try to sneak through? Yeah, do it. I cast Pass Without a Trace. Now let's vogue. This changes every time! Sweet! All right, so Pass Without a Trace is cast,",while you two both make stealth rolls.
Stealth,"The grappling arrow I used on the little halfling, I can get that back, right? Yeah, you retrieved it. Just making sure. I'll continue on down the hallway. I join him. Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a Trace? No. No? She had to break it to use Stoneskin. It's a concentration spell, isn't it? Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself. You did. All right. So go ahead and make a",stealth roll.
Perception,"actual room. The building in the center, it looks almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how it's placed in the center of the room. Closed stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of the same platinum-like material as the container that you guys are carrying the horn in. Oh, wow. Oh, we made it. Are there sapphires all over the walls in here, then? Not the walls of the actual chamber itself, just this central building right there. We're not stealing from this place.","MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone"
Stealth,"symbol. Before she touches anything, can I let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room. You may do that. Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that. Can I shift to her right flank, just at the corner of the mausoleum structure? Right there. Just so everybody's aware, those things we just fought? There's a ton more of them on the other side of this little chamber. Oh, thanks for telling us. No problem.","MATT: Grog, make a stealth check."
Stealth,"It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that much. Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area right here is all spiky growth. And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and thorns. Good to know. Briar. All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over-- Over here? Over there, yeah. Our side's the best! (laughter)",MATT: Go ahead and make another stealth check.
Acrobatics,"Kima's dead. Kima? The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing out, they're no longer encumbered by the box. Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns around, the first one comes leaping off of the structure, runs towards her and gives one giant sweep with one of its blades. Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade streak across the front of her silver armor. She takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it, but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an","acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and"
Religion,"of the town. As you approach closer to this statue, it's not just a statue. You see it is actually sitting atop what looks to be a large, blocky fortress-like temple. Unlike the Platinum Sanctuary, which is a very beautiful but simple array, this one has a crenellated top to each of these walled structures. You can see braziers blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top of it. You can see, as you approach the front of this, there are two giant stone doorways with steps that look up to it and what looks to be two gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides and then open up outward towards the entire city in front of it. I'm going to ask you guys to make","a religion check, if you could."
Stealth,"standing over his body this extremely built, aggressive, looks like another human female with her hair pulled back in a very tight ponytail just spits on his body, turns around and wipes the blood from the front of her face. Snaps her fingers, and you can see folks bring a ladder and lean it over the side and she climbs up the ladder as everyone cheers on her way up. Before we get up to the crowd, I transform into Minxie. I'm going Minxie. And I catch up to Grog. Going Minxie. Oh, they don't like magic. Did they see me? I'm trying to do it stealthily before it happens.",MATT: You can make a stealth check if you like.
Stealth,"Oh, he's already down? Well, Grog, what else do you want to do before you prepare? What do I want to do to prepare? Well, if you haven't gone down yet. The other guy has come down the ladder. I took a drink from the cask of ale-- Wait, I come over to Grog and I just look in his eyes and I say, listen, you've got this, I can't give you anything else, but you've got this, man. And I also very quickly take out my Potion of Fire Giant Strength and I slip it to him before he takes a drink of his ale. I don't know if I hand it to him.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Athletics,"pile-drive grapple, and you instinctively kick off of him and his third attack is completely wasted. It's now your go. No one fucks with Phillip Jr. I would like to bull rush and try and tackle him, and if it succeeds, I'd like to headbutt him on the ground. Okay, okay. It's an action to do that, so you can use your bonus action to attempt-- And I would only get two attacks, right? You only get one with this, technically. It's an action to grapple. Okay. Do it. All right.",MATT: So go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Acrobatics,"Six, nice. So as you hold him down, his face, (wham). Head goes, cracks against the ground of the Crucible. As he starts picking his head up again, you drill back again, (wham) hit him a second time. This time, you can see now. His nose was already busted before. Now it's nearly concave. It's like he didn't have a nose before and there's just a bloody void where it once was. He's still smiling in a weird, twisted way. He seems to be enjoying this almost as much as you. You go down for the third one, and this time he reaches up and grabs your elbow. He's going to take his turn to attempt to break your grapple as his action. Go ahead and roll either an athletics",or an acrobatics check.
Deception,"his head into your midsection, picks you up over his head, slams you onto the ground, and as you're on the ground, he runs up and soccer-ball kicks you in the side of your ribs, just (whack). You hear a crack as the impact hits and you can feel that surging, shooting, burning pain begin to fill the side of your torso. It's your go. What else do I have? What can I do? You can throw some dirt in his face! From the stands, I turn to a portly gentleman next to me and I say, sir, do you see what that fucking little elf said about your mother? He called her a name I can't even repeat. I'm so sorry.",MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.
Deception,"Grog. You can see the other bookie, who is dressed similarly in the purplish robes you saw before, also begins to heal our good fighting half-orc friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of coins from him. The clerics of Kord are the ones actually running this, it looks like. You come to in the pit, Grog, beaten, wearied, and fatigued because of your frenzied rage. However, you have been defeated in the Crucible. That was painful. That was so close. I go down and nurse him, nurse his head, hold him, and just tell him, Grog, you won! You did it, buddy!",MATT: Make a deception roll.
Survival,"you with the smell of wet earth, moss. Vines and branches dangle from and reach from every direction, and you can see there are, you can walk through the path here, but nearing trees themselves, the roots are so large and so twisted where they enter the ground. You're definitely going to have to keep up with your ranger friend here. Just like the old days. Now we've touched down and we're traveling? You guys are in the forest pushing through various walkways. Go ahead and make a survival check with advantage.",SAM: Survival check? Is that for her?
Investigation,"turned its path about and then exited the same pathway. So as you're following it along for a good 15 minutes or so, you come across a small opening in the forest where you can see what looks to be a very messily partially devoured carcass of something. Is it big? It looks like it was pretty big, it's definitely spread out over this area. I think it ate something here, you guys. Good ranging. Thank you. I'd like to try and identify the animal that it ate.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"sort of furred beast. Huge in size at one point, it is long-dead for at least-- Like moose-big or bigger? No, as big as some of the umber hulks you've fought. But it looks humanoid-ish, more primate-like. The more you look at it, it looks like it may have been at one point a large, massive ape of some kind. But it has been torn open, limbs scattered all across this small clearing. You can see there are a series of bite and scratch marks across it, and most of its internal organs are missing. I don't know what we're tracking, but I think it's friendly.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if I can
Perception,"creature, appear to be post-mortem by quite some time. So it was killed by civilized folks and then torn apart by this thing. Maybe the Slayer's Take. Can I figure out what kind, was it some bird creature? Is all Percy could-- Ape creature. It's essentially a massive, for lack of a better term, a dire-sized ape. Dire-ape. It's possible somebody was feeding it. Should we continue on, keep tracking? My sister and I are going to check and see if there's any sign of it in the area.","LAURA: Yeah, perception check around. Oh, that"
Perception,"of inspiration. (singing) And the ranger's going to range, range, range, range, range. And the tracker's going to track, track, track, track, track. I'm just going to watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. Watch her range. (singing) Watch her range. What do I need to add? A d10. Okay, so 19. Oh good. Three points. All right. You continue moving forward off the track for another ten minutes or so before you see some movement ahead. Perception?",MATT: Perception check.
Stealth,"All right. You continue moving forward off the track for another ten minutes or so before you see some movement ahead. Perception? Perception check. I'll join in that. 21. 12. 18. How far away are we from each other? You guys are keeping a pretty close view, you're a little behind them, but you're letting them push forward unless you choose to do anything otherwise. I'm going stealth.",MATT: All right. Make a stealth check. You and
Stealth,"Is the foliage around us green? Brown? Standard foliage color? In this area, because of the nature of the rich earth, most of the foliage here is a deep green. I'm going to turn us all deep green. With Seeming. With what now? Seeming. Yes with Seeming. I spread my Seeming all over us, turning us green. With Seeming all over us. There's nothing you can't ruin. As the hue of your garments begin to shift to the color of the surrounding forest, I'd like",everybody to make a stealth check who hasn't
Athletics,"regular attack through the magical bow of fire. And that is 17. Hail of Thorns is an action to cast, though, isn't it? You've already used your bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark. Then never mind, I don't do anything. I just fucking fucked that up. It's okay, it's a surprise round. Do you want to do anything with your self-placement or Trinket-wise? Yeah, I want to climb a tree that I'm next to. Okay. Using your movement. Go ahead and make, we'll say an",athletics check to climb the tree.
Arcana,"my ring and Chain Lightning him again. Chain Lightning is a 6th-level spell. Yeah, I know, and I had one stored in my ring. Your ring can only store up to a 3rd-level spell. We went over this last time. It's okay. No, I thought that was the Ioun Stone. We all learned something today, kids. I don't do that. Instead, fine. I'm going to cast Telekinesis once. And I'm instantly going to do quicken spell and do five sorcerer points to cast it immediately again. Cast it on one head and another head and (bashing, tying sounds). To try and wrap them all and choke them.",MATT: Go ahead and roll an arcana check for the
Investigation,"(laughter) Just make a canister, put some black powder in there, put the thing together. It doesn't even have a fuse, it's something I can toss and shoot to trigger. Ooh. Interesting. I will say, due to time constraints, you would probably have to skip a decent breakfast to do this. So, be aware you may be hungry later on. I've got food. Done We've got dried food rations in the bag. I'll have a granola bar.",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Insight,"I do. Oh. How fascinating. I am Grog, the unintimidated. It's nice to know your true name Phillip-- I mean Grog. (whispered) I think she knows. I would like to run a quick perception test. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to figure out if she's titled. She certainly strikes me as titled. I think she has blood. She may not have blue blood but-- (whispers) She's got blood.",MATT: This would be more of an insight check.

Investigation,"you sense that there is worship of Melora here. Melora which is considered the goddess of wilderness and the sea and is one of the five-- soon to be six if Pike's temple raises-- deities that essentially rule the belief system and lifestyle of the city of Vasselheim. So through the blessing and touch of Melora in this district they are able to treat the land as magically fertile territory to grow. You gather upon stepping inside that there's a cluster of dirty looking, but very, very cluttered and busy taverns, inns and general stores, like the entire portion of the district that isn't farmland is jammed into this one little corner. Go ahead and",make an investigation check.
Perception,"previously. He is eager to tell the story and is in full belief. The frustration, and the only things that detract from his child-like excitement at telling this tale, is his moments of side looking frustration to the other members of the tavern that do not take him seriously, it seems. Dagon does seem to be truthful in, at least, believing what he is saying to you. Thank you so much for your information-- I take a gold coin and I'm just like, is this enough? Yes, that's good. Thank you. So we-- we'll be going. Yeah? Can I perception and see how heavy that bag of gold actually looks? I just want to know.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"Keyleth would be proud. Don't-- how about don't tell Keyleth? I miss my brother. Okay. You guys get off of the main road, as that's probably not a very good area to be out in the open. You find, after about a five to ten minute walk, a small opening and along the way you find a tree that looks viable. There's a small slope of hill that heads up to an upper platform area maybe about five to ten feet up, and a small opening that you think would be a fitting place to put a fire that wouldn't be in danger of setting the nearby vegetation aflame. You go ahead and start looking for firewood. Go ahead and make an",athletics roll.
Perception,"Wake up, Grog. What? Mom? (screams and flails) Ugh. Grog. Sorry. Is he always this loud? Yes. All right. All right, keep sleeping! (whispers) I mean, keep sleeping. You're safe while I'm out. Aldor! What? Huh? (laughter) As the rest of you maintain or continue your sleep. Grog keeps a very watchful eye in the darkened woods around. Grog, go ahead and",make a perception check.
Intimidation,"After the Hammer, orcs are nothing. So, the first strike you slam into his upper torso area and it actually digs about four or five inches in. He reaches up and grabs-- drops his weapon and grabs the axe and tries to pull it out of his body. You, however, reach up with your fist and slam it down on the axe shoving it about five or six more inches. You can see his actual shoulder and arm fall away from his torso as his eyes roll back and he falls limp against the blade. With my third attack, I'd like to turn to his friend, grab him by the throat and go-- It's death, or target practice for my friends. Talk.",MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll.
Persuasion,"fate and the rather rapid destruction of its entire band-- (speaks Orcish) Anyone here speak Orcish? I speak Orc. So, my friend-- What did he say? What did he say? You hear him say, ""Death may come, but the rest will find you. You come into our wood. It's ""only a matter of time before you're eaten."" Tell him we're just passing through. We are simply passing through. We are in search of something. If you choose to help us, we may let you live. Yeah, 'may'. And it is not one of yours.",MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Insight,"good as Keyleth's Giant. Almost. Almost. You can see a look of fear and his eyes dart about the rest of the party as they all begin stepping out of the firelight and into the darkness surrounding him. He gauges the scenario. Looks down at the dead dire wolf. He gives you another look and you still have the flaring blaze of your angry Thaumaturgy eyes. He says in Common, very broken Common-- ""Very well. I live. I serve."" You can see his blood now trickling down to the corner of his mouth. What, is he going to fight with us? Can I see if he's truthful? Insight?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Nature,"Just the tongue? Like that yes, yes. I rip the tongue out of the head. That's a good idea, Vex. Do we need the pelt of the dire wolf? I put the orc tongue in the bag of holding. And the orc head. Both. Just asking. All right. With the lip, now we-- you're slowly-- The lip is in my belt, baby. And I would like to extract the canines from the dire wolf. From the dire wolf, all right. I would like",you to go ahead and make a nature check.

Sorry, what do I do?",MATT: Roll a d20 and add your nature check bonus.
Perception,"group. Thankfully, though, you have Vex guiding you on this path and where it would be a very difficult experience pushing through this forest, especially with the time limit you have, she is able to find the quickest paths to dodge any of the heavy areas that are dense with dangerous snowfall. I would also like to perception ahead and make sure that nothing is going to sneak attack us again. Understood, understood. Very good call. All right. In that regard, I would like you",to go ahead and make a perception check.
Stealth,"manage to avoid what looks like a long frozen lake in the center of the forest with a series of heavily iced-over stone ruins. Don't walk on this lake. Oh, good call, good call. You move around and in the distance you swear you see the glimmer of some glowing entity in the midst of these ruins and you manage to keep enough of a distance. Everyone make a stealth check on this. So roll a d20 and add your stealth bonus. Add it, or take away? Because it's negative. For you it'd be taking away from your",stealth roll.
Religion,"13. 24. 11. All right, so. Though clumsy in form, the group is able to pull you far enough away where they cover your bases on this, and this glowing entity doesn't seem to take notice of your passage as it slowly fades into the stone ruins once again. You press on towards the mountain-- Should we go check that glowing entity out? What was it? Do I-- oh, do I know? I have an arcana, or would it be nature, or? For this, I would say go ahead and make a","religion check, actually."
Perception,"This is very much like home for me. Do we see any-- anything along the bottom, the edge of the mountain that looks like it could open into a cavern of some sort? There are a number of large rocks and boulders that seem to have tumbled off the mountain and embedded themselves in the ground in sections. You do see what looks to be a cavern of some kind that is in the-- at the base of this mountain, it's about 20, 25 feet high and about 35 feet wide. Should we maybe go in? Does it look like we can climb the mountain, or is it just too sheer?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Persuasion,"That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that. (laughter) It was very impressive. It was very impressive. All right, Grog's up first. (Grog voice) Grog-- (Grog voice) Would like-- (Grog voice) No, Grog doesn't want to Rage! Grog shouts out in Giant, wait! My giant masters were killed by a white dragon, which we think is here. Will you help us fight him? Okay. So as Grog stands there, shouting this out to both sides to the two giants, I want to",have Grog go ahead and roll a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"wasn't it? The duergar king you fought in the Underdark. I have a question. So I rolled to get my health back and I got more hit points than I had before-- You can't go more than your maximum. You're at full hit points now. I want to borrow Grog for just a second and ask these two if they've encountered the dragon before, and what its disposition is. Anything we should know. I want you to go ahead, and I will say through Grog-- this is going to be interesting. Since Grog is translating, I'm going to go ahead",and have you roll a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"minds Yes. Your people have been persecuted for so long, and you have lost so many of the female version of you, and your children, and you serve them now. Do you want to live as slaves? ""We want to live."" So to live as a slave is better than-- ""To not live at all?"" We are offering you the opportunity to stop your servitude. To end it forever. (grunts) They keep walking What? We'll see how this plays out. This is a process here. You guys heavily failed some early","persuasion rolls here, they're in a very negative"
Perception,"of what you have done. Pick and choose your words very carefully. Zahra sheds a tear, which freezes instantly on her face, and her internal flame melts it off. That's pretty badass. As you continue to walk, you can see the center of this village is completely in tatters. A lot of the wood and the dried brush and the furs and thick leathers that these giants had gathered and constructed their civilization out of is all just shattered and rended to the floor and then frozen over, left in this weird picturesque, almost a tapestry. A frozen moment in time of utter desolation. Actually, I want you to all to","roll a perception check, if you could."
History,"one thing that catches your mind before the spell ends is the name that it finally came upon itself, the name that it heard whispered as one of its would-be hunters was suddenly-- Jeff. (laughter) Jeff the dragon. The name Rimefang rings through your mind. His name is Rimefang. The two frost giants stop their walking and turn. ""Rimefang."" They nod and look up to the giant structure they constructed. Oh wow! Can I make a history to sww if I know anyone in the guild who has been named Rimefang?",MATT: Make a history check on this.
History,"Make a history check on this. It's a 21. Okay, Rimefang, you gather, is the name of the dragon proper. And there's another drink for you guys out there. They made fun of me for using the word proper. Drink! This dragon took the name Rimefang. Because in a lot of dragons as they evolve and begin to really create a lair, they really make themselves known publicly and really draw the fear out once they feel they're in a comfortable position. You feel this dragon is just starting to get to that point where it's eager to drive fear into the","local populace. From your history check, you do"
Perception,"make their way through this cavern structure. So you are the small beads of visual lightness in the entire structure. The floor itself is slick, and there are bits of rough rock that you can find foot purchase but there are a few moments where some of you slip and you lose about ten feet and then catch yourself and have to move upward with this slight 35-degree incline, slowly spiraling upward. You push forward for about 30 minutes or so in this long, seemingly-- for lack of a better term, there isn't a lot of changed variation to it  it's just a gradual spiral in itself. I want to keep perception out to make sure that nothing is ahead of us.",MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Insight,"Not happy. No. He is full of bile and vitriol, and he likes to be worshiped. We could pretend to be worshiping him. But he'll still want to eat us. But yes, we could do that. I mean, he didn't eat these two guys! It might be something to think about. At least to get close to him. Before we spring an attack, yes. Go ahead and make an intelligence check. With advantage because it's pertaining to dragons? (laughs) She's a stickler.",LAURA: Is that an insight check?
Perception,"Gee, I had a spell that would be useful, but it's not ready. Thanks for that update. I'm just being honest. I could've lied, said that I totally prepared that spell, but I could've been knowing Giant the whole time, so I just. (laughs) Oops. If anybody falls, I can make them fall gently. That's on the list. Oh, that's good. Is that Feather Fall? Nice. Okay, I perceive some more and see if I see any traps ahead of us the whole time. All right. You go ahead and make a",perception check as you move forward.
Stealth,"Oh, come on, giants. Help us out. So as you guys enter the chamber, the actual air here is more still and cold than at any point of the interior of the cavern has been. Even breathing inward hurts in itself as the freezing air hits your lungs. Rimefang sits there, perched on top of this central platform, grinning down towards the rest of the group. You, who have shouted this out, Lyra, about having an offering. Rimefang immediately leans forward. ""An offering, you say?"" I want to make my way further up. While he's talking, I want to make my way along the wall a little.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Persuasion,"And then you put it back in the bag. And then you give it to him. There's this low, guttural snarl (snarls). It leans forward, sneaking down off the perch a little bit. Its head moves forward and stretches outward, no more than maybe ten feet from your face. You can see it inspecting the diamond as you're holding it by the Mage Hand, floating above the rest of the bag. Chuckles to itself. (chuckles) ""This is your measly offering?"" There is a diamond of much greater size and value in this pouch. But first, we want to hear that you are going to allow us safe passage out of here before we turn it over to you.",MATT: Persuasion check.

Who has good animal handling? Wait, we have to harvest it special? Part of harvesting the organs from the creature is a delicate process. Is it nature?

Nature,"He was a white dragon! Or wait, are you sure it wasn't the blue dragon that we harvested? No, it was a white dragon, we have 37 left over. Okay. We have 37 dragon teeth from the first white dragon. Can I also get-- if there's any powder left or anything, for myself, I would like to-- Claws, still. We have to get claws still.

It would be enough if you were to bring it to a master craftsman, to possibly construct a set of armor from them. That's why we have so many pounds of dragon scales from the previous dragons! We could make three sets of armor right now. I'm going to look around and just see if there's a stash or a hoard that he was gathering. All right, there are individual gold pieces embedded all through. It would take you weeks to chisel it all from the walls. Are there any giant gems that we can see?",MATT: Everyone make a perception check.

Within the quiver, you see most of the arrows are frozen solid within the quiver, but there is one that seems unaffected by the ice. Can I tell what it is? You pull out the arrow. It appears to be a deep forest green, and the actual shaft of the arrow has a texture to it, almost a rough metallic texture. Take it! I'm taking it! Are you kidding me?

Perception,"a little out the ordinary, or maybe, in the ordinary. Yes, I like that phrasing. Have to imagine anywhere this thing goes, there's going to be strange deaths associated with it. We might as well look there. That's actually a good idea, as well. And where we're walking, are there shops and stands, as well, or is it residential?

And she goes and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a mask. This little purple mask that seems to have small fake gems forming the outside, with a couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around the head. It's simple, but it's pretty.

Well, then give to him so we can get out of here. I'm circling around.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"(laughter) We'll get to that. As you lean forward, forcing your presence on this Bastion, his hand's still holding the edge of his rapier.

But if you're going to go ""about asking questions and not offering proper compensation for information, well, then. I think ""we have no business here.""

Taking a moment as you sneak up behind the one he's talking to-- the two guys are shoulder to shoulder, squaring off with the rest of this group. The one that had been relieving himself in the alleyway is a little bit closer to you. You can see as he put his tunic right and everything, he jostled around and revealed a couple of small pouches on his side. One of which, you heard a clinking of glass on the inside.

""They wouldn't have any more information than we do, no.""",MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?
History,"Velvet Cabaret? Velvet Cabaret. It's close. So we know that this guy-- while we walk there, I was talking. We know that this guy is a demon from the Nine Hells. So, he seems to be targeting wealthy people. Do you think these are people that tried to get under his control, under his servitude, and it didn't go his way, so he ended up killing them? Folk don't go into the Velvet Cabaret unless they got a lot of coin. Someone like Lord Tyrell. Do we know anything about him? Does his name ring any bells for us at all?",MATT: Roll a history check.
History,"Do we know anything about him? Does his name ring any bells for us at all? Roll a history check. Oh boy. (laughs) It happened again! This is unprecedented. You are the nega-Percy right now. Just telling you. I'm just telling you. This is impressive. You think it isn't real. You think it's a thing I make jokes about. You take a moment to conjecture where you may have heard the name.

I sigh heavily. And I pull the rug. You pull the rug, revealing a wooden floor. Plain slats. You thought that was going to be good! With a point, too!

That's me right there. I'll follow. I'll keep on Thorbir's six. Okay. I'll stay 15 feet behind him. 15 feet behind? All right. And Keyleth, you continue up that way. All right, so that'll be the marching order. So I've got my axe out. And may I make a",perception check to see what I see? To just see if

It's not a mine shaft. What were you going to say? I would like to make a-- you tell me what check it is. What I want to do is to look down into this thick mud stuff. What I'm looking for are tracks, and if I do well enough, I want to see if I can get a sense of how fast the thing was going. Has it slowed down because it's comfortable, or is it still running?","MATT: Okay, make another survival check."
Perception,"So I'm underground. Actually, as a dwarf I'll give you advantage on that, so roll again. That makes sense, this is your place. Well, the higher one was four. The lower one was a one. The higher one was a four? Remember what I told you about the Wheaton dice curse? I'm sorry. Because no one will believe me. No one ever believes me. He's been taking pictures of all his fails so everyone believes it. At this point, I'd be amazed that he hasn't helped us in any way, shape, or form, and cast a",perception check of my own.
Arcana,"13. 13? All right. I don't know if you have numbers low enough. Two. Keyleth, what do you have? Six. Six, okay. All right. As the skittering seems to go to a fervored frenzy, you can see masses and masses of extremely matted fur moving and quivering through this refuse as a series of rat swarms pour out of the edges of this giant dung pile. And where at the center that giant entity has revealed itself to be a terrifying visage of some kind. I'm going to have you go ahead and roll",an arcana check.

There's a bunch of rats down here! Rats! Walk faster. (clunk clunk) To the edge, there. How far down is it? 15 feet. And it is soft ground. Can I jump and land on those rats? You know what? Sure. Go ahead and make an",athletics check.
Perception,"spattered-- You ruined your new dress. I know. I got scorched by Tiberius's fireball. You fought well, though. I'm looking for the way out of here. I'm looking to see where the rakshasa went. Looking on the far side, it's partially buried in the ground from the collection here, but you can see there is a bit of a push, like the door had been opened briefly and pushed things away, then slammed shut, and it's slowly starting to coalesce back towards it. All right. Hold on, everybody. I walk right","toward it, perception checking the area around it"
Perception,"this room. And you get the feeling this door isn't open very often, if at all, and the little bit of slime that has coasted through only goes about five, ten feet into a long stone hallway that disappears in the darkness no more than maybe 20 feet from you. Even with the low light, you can see pretty far. To the right and left of you, sets of iron bars. Okay. Tibs. Follow that. Try and keep behind me. And I throw up the hood and go as low to the ground as I can, and I start to Gollum along the floor, looking at the ground in front of me in the dim light, trying to see if I can see any traps ahead of me.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"Okay. As you enter this area and start stepping in, the air itself has a very chemical smell to it. It's hard to describe. There's something musty and untouched to the air, but there's also some sort of gentle hint of an acrid scent. Do you guys continue forward through this prison area? I'm looking at the floor and everything as far out as I can see ahead of me. Okay. What's above us? Looking up, it's about 15 feet up, and it is another smooth stone ceiling. The construction here looks old. You, specifically, go ahead and","make a perception check. With advantage, because"
Investigation,"carved a few hundred years ago, and the metal bars as you move past-- you guys see this too-- the doorways that lead into these, some appear to be locked and some are completely open, easy to swing, and as you pull it open, (creak) very heavy rust against those iron doors, probably affected largely by the nearby moisture emanating from the room and whatever chemical's hanging in the air. Are we still lit? You're still lit by his Light spell, yes. And there's nothing really in the prison cells, with the exception of one skeleton? Well, that was in one room. If you want to go ahead and check around, go ahead and make an",investigation check.
Perception,"Yeah, I'll look around in the cells. Natural 20! There is balance to the universe. As you're walking past, Keyleth, looking over on one side, you see further up, with a bunch of the thatch pushed around it, there appears to be a corpse that doesn't have the layer of dust that a number of the other skeletal piles in some of the other cells seem to have. The door to get into the cell, though, does appear to be locked. Vax. Need your help  this is locked. What's in there? Looks like a fresh dead guy? Okay. Out comes the pick. I'm going to",perception check that corpse through the cell.
Arcana,"""That was two weeks ago."" But he said he's been coming and going, so maybe he was just leaving? Coming the same direction we came from, though. That seems odd. And a man, a dwarf, and a woman. Weeks ago. Not five minutes ago. The spell fades, and the corpse falls back to its original pose, jaw left open, aghast in its final moments. Thorbir's right. We're burning time. We need to go in. Go in where? Do we go back the direction the dwarf came?",ORION: I rolled a 23 arcana check on Thorbir's
Arcana,"I'm sorry, but we came from that direction? From this door, yes. This would've connected right there. Okay. Every second we're here, it's getting away. I agree. You're absolutely right. We're going in. When we're in there, you keep it busy, and I will carve it up. I will keep it busy. Try not to get your dick bit by a rat. I slide past Tiberius, crouch down to the ground again, and start scuttling along the ground. Looking, listening.",ORION: What was the ruling on the arcana check?
Stealth,"As you see them approaching here, stepping in your direction, they are both dressed in full Duskmeadow Bastion armor. The one on the far end appears to be older, balding with thinning gray hair. The one who's further up is in his forties. Big thick brown beard, hair pulled back into a ponytail, and they're both lightly conversing to each other. Not paying much attention, like they're running through a routine. I start pushing back on Thorbir, backing everybody up, silently pushing backward and trying to steer everyone in a heap backwards and to the side of the cell we just came from. Just trust me.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Stealth,"Did I get them into the cell? You pushed them far back and into the cell? Yeah, that was what I wanted to do, just backwards to everybody. Yeah, and as this is going on, I dissipate the Light spell. Okay. Light spell vanishes. He walks up and turns the corner. I give everybody a group hug with my Cloak of Elvenkind and try to make a big rag pile out of this corner. I'm very uncomfortably pressed against Thorbir's backside. Okay. The cloak can only really cover you and partially another person. The rest of you all",make a stealth check.
Perception,"How long does that last? It's permanent! Let's go. It's time to move. All right, back around the corner, following around, looking, listening. Everybody the same. That chemical smell is getting stronger and stronger. It's burning your nose a little bit. So Kashaw. If you're the only one who knows about this goddess, that means she also killed your parents? Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. Perception? I got you, baby. Well, that was perception.",WIL: So I'm attempting to make a perception roll

It's very thick and looks like it's melted through the basis of the floor and almost like it would continue under, around, and out of this room into whatever is beyond.

You see flashes of light from within, and a few other claps of thunder rolling over the mountain range. Does it look natural? It looks like a thunderstorm. It's not ominously dark more than what you're used to, but it looks like there is a thunderstorm blowing through.","MARISHA: Can I do a nature check, see how long"
Perception,"started. Vox Machina, that's all it is. Wait, is that Kashaw? Made you look. Break the tension! Never mind, you've got it. You continue riding towards the mountain range at the base of the Sunder Peak Mountains. Eventually the forest begins to give way as the ground itself becomes less and less hospitable to vegetation. There's a certain smell to the air that seems to come through the wind that buffets the bottom of the mountain range itself. It smells like a distant forest fire. Like, you can smell almost like burnt cedar, a little bit of ash to the air. You make your way to the base. Everyone",roll a perception check.
Perception,"a switchback, and you can see it's beginning to pull inwards towards what looks like a ravine in the mountain range. There's an area where the actual mountain carves inward and leads into the mountain range proper. During that time, Vex, as you guys are making your way up to this slight inward path and it starts pushing into the mountain range, less dangerous and less pressed against the mountain as you were previously, you notice up at the top there are a few shadowed figures just out of your visual range that you can just make out over the backlight of the clouds in the sky. Do they look--",MATT: You can make a perception check.
Stealth,"figures just out of your visual range that you can just make out over the backlight of the clouds in the sky. Do they look-- You can make a perception check. Fuck. I chose poorly. That's terrible. Yeah. Eight. Eight. At this distance, it's hard to really make out any sort of visual on their form, their size, but you just see there's a handful of them and it looks like three figures that are moving in unison along the ridge a little ways up ahead of you guys. Shut up.",MATT: Can I go ahead and get a stealth check from

Shut up. Can I go ahead and get a stealth check from the group? With disadvantage on the ones that failed their constitution saves. How do we know if we failed? The fail is the nine or below. Yeah. I'll let you know if it's a fail or not, but you guys,","everyone has to make a stealth check, and the ones"
Perception,"You know you don't have to breathe all of it in every time. Oh, right, no. 15, sorry, 15. For stealth, right? For stealth. (coughs loudly) As you guys make your way into the path and she points this out, there's a couple people that kind of, there's a quiet silence, and then (coughing) a couple of coughs coming through. Shushed as best you can, you can see the figures shift and then vanish from sight. Should we hurry? What do you think? Well, they know now.",MARISHA: I'm going to do a perception check and
Perception,"territory. You know that centurions usually are sent out, and people keep watch on the landscape around, but you have no idea. Because I know the mountains, are we still on that crappy narrow precipice? That crappy path is starting to move inward finally towards the actual mountain  it's starting to crest over into the top area, where it goes into almost more like a ravine where the two walls of the mountain come together to give you a small valley path that leads-- Could I look and see if there are any boulder, avalanche-type situations that I can see--","MATT: Sure, make a perception check."
Arcana,"There's going to be art for that. Don't say things like that out loud. Do you guys continue? I think so. Can I-- I mean-- Let's continue on. All right. You continue pushing in, and this area where the mountain range tends to collide to this path that then leads on. It's slowly winding around and heading upward and closer and closer in towards where the mountain range crests. There's a couple more flashes of lightning, some thunder, and you all look around. I rolled an 18, because I want to do an",arcana check for anything I can feel from that
Acrobatics,"Spending a grit point. It's been so long. There we are. Yeah! Oh, the curse is broken, that's 29, 31. 31. Definitively hits. 31. What does the arm shot do? It's no damage, right? The arm shot is-- okay, sorry. It's been a while. I've never done this one before. No damage, but it drops one item of my choice. So as it's lifting the boulder, you fire, and it hits the elbow out from under it. And I use the strength of the shot to pick myself up and keep on running.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. So as
Nature,"(laughing) Okay! There, see? Take that, game, take that. Far off in the distance, Keyleth, as the rest of you look at the landscape, you see what looks like a small forest, a very localized forest right in the center of the valley. You can see a cluster of trees that exists about a mile, a mile and a half away from your current position. As you guys continue pushing forward, you start seeing larger stone clusters and formations, almost like a very violent activity were forcing and jutting up portions of stone out of this caldera at some point.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if it's
Persuasion,"We just wait or Keyleth talks. Wait. About a moment later, you see a small red glow appear from a portion of the wall on the opposite side. Red glow, looking like a portion of the stone, about this wide, begins to glow bright red before dripping off molten, leaving a small slit. You can now see through the slit, a few heads appearing as one steps into, eyes, shifting, peering through the small space. ""You trespass ""into our home. I will ask you once your business before we let the mountain's fury take you."" Please. I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari, and I am here to further my Aramente. He looks back for a second. Go ahead and",make a persuasion roll with advantage.
Nature,"and you can see the lava begin to grow more and more active, sending off little spittles of rock. I push it out and continue to focus. You guys begin to see now the lava is shifting and beginning to roil and you're almost afraid it's going to start bubbling over and fill the area, and this nervousness grips your heart. Especially you, Vax, who had previously had some unhappy run-ins with molten rock. It's a genuine fear that you hadn't quite acknowledged since that moment, and you begin to feel really uncomfortable being this close to this opening. As you continue to focus, you hear Cerkonos's voice again, calm and methodical. ""Ask permission."" I'd like you to",go ahead and roll a nature check.
Stealth,"You can certainly try. Do you have Pass Without a Trace right now? I do have Pass Without a Trace. I can cast that on us. Okay. So you cast Pass Without a Trace on the group. As you do, the magic pools, a bunch of the ashes (whoosh) from the ground surround each of you, and there's this gentle cloud of ash that just tends to drift off your body and perpetually replace itself from the surrounding terrain. It does offer you some blanket of visual obscuring from any sort of high vantage point or distant vantage point. Up close, not so much. I'll have",all of you guys roll a stealth check. With a plus
Perception,"these streams of lava, and there, about 20 to 30 feet ahead of you, you see a single stone obelisk that rises out of the ground about 15 feet up, and towards the top you see embedded in it a single, mildly glowing, what looks like a fist- or heart-sized ruby that is embedded into it like a beacon, or a small fiery lighthouse in the center of this open plain. That's pretty. That looks like a stone spire to me. Well, it's shiny. It's rather shiny, yeah. Let's go there. All right. As you guys approach, stepping towards the obelisk, around the back of it, make a",perception check.
Survival,"You don't know. No, don't do it, Pike! He's dying! No, I'm okay. I got back 19 points. Okay. You shrug off that damage. You don't heal past it, you just shrug off that damage. Okay, good. So you take no damage from that. Oh. That's good. So. As you guys are racing forward, the storm is still blowing and you can hear Cerkonos shouting as a hawk, adding this beacon of noise as you guys are trying to follow suit. Since you're leading the way, Keyleth, I want you to go ahead",and make a survival check.
Acrobatics,"lungs. The wind tunnel is helping reduce the DC of the roll to a certain extent, but this is a very dangerous storm to be in. Essentially, every minute that passes that you're in it-- Can I use a hit dice to heal myself at all? You need a short rest to get there. You guys make your way to the outskirts of the portal and you leap through, as one by one, you all jump into this portal, the druids following behind. The sense of falling becomes this jettison motion as you are shoved and thrown into the air, out of the portal, and landing about 15 feet, 20 feet from the fall. I need all of you guys to make",an acrobatics check.
Insight,"I wasn't even in a brothel. Oh, you weren't? I walked toward the brothel, but then I bumped into Zahra. Remember Zahra? Oh, Zahra! She invited me over. We talked all night. One thing led to another-- nothing untoward-- but we just had a nice slumber party. It was lovely. It was me and a couple of tieflings. Three, I think. We were doing each other's hair, telling stories, playing songs. It was wonderful! Can I roll to see if he's bullshitting? You can go ahead and make a-- this would be an insight.",TRAVIS: Yeah!

I was waiting on my first request before. Oh, what was your first request? To see if Keyleth could do anything, but a wineskin? Yes. Oh, thank you. Can I do a check to see if I can tell what Lockheed has? What kind of disease?",MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a medicine check.
Athletics,"All righty. Our house is a D&D cave. I'm so sorry. As you're preparing for this circumstance, you are up first. Grog, you have initiative. I race towards Kern, and I duck down as if I'm going to go into a form tackle towards his waist. I take a step to the side at the last second and wrap my arms around his waist from behind, pick him up to DDT him over my shoulder. (cheering) The DDT! The DDT! Okay. For this, go ahead and make an",athletics check.
Athletics,"Okay. 23. 23 hits. Great. That is-- motherfucker, six. Six damage? Yes. All righty. I would like to then reach forward, as he's reeling back from that hit, with both of my thumbs and throw them towards his eyes. You're going to attempt to blind? All right, so what this is going to be is for your second attack, a loose grapple, and we'll see if you can manage to push forward from that point. So go",ahead and make an athletics check.
Athletics,"21-- aw. 15. 15. Inspiration! If you want to use it. That's a 22. 22 hits. (cheering) So you rush forward to grab. You have hold of his head now. There's no damage this round, but you're enabling yourself now for the rest of the round to attempt to push into his eyes. There's no damage on this one. You grab the side of his head, and you see his eyes open with this look of fear at the unexpected ferocity from you. Go ahead and",make an athletics check.
Athletics,"you've ever tried. You get about a quarter to a half an inch in with your teeth, definitely taking a chunk and (tearing sound) tearing out what you can, but based on the general hardiness of his half-orc structure, you don't get to a jugular or any major vein, but you do leave a gash that leaves a significant mark on his body. That's the first attack. I pull back from the bite, and I whisper into his ear, I was wondering what was going to your spirit, or your body. And I would like to try to pick him up over my head and bring him down on my knee, Bane-style. Batman!",MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check. With
Athletics,"time, this time Kern rolls out of the way. He manages to just avoid the third slam. What's the total damage on that? Did I roll? It's good. Eight and eight! Damn! You turned him into a stain. Kern, no longer stunned, now gets up, (grunts) holding the back of his side. You suck, Kern! You also smell! (chuckles) Glances up for a moment at you, and sees you raising your fists and gives a grin. Looks back towards you and lunges towards you now. He's going to attempt a grapple at you. Go ahead and",make an athletics check.
Athletics,"teeth grasp on to the top of your lip, and with a sickening sharp, burning sensation, (wet ripping noise) your upper lip is now torn from the front of your face. As you see Kern reel back, a streak of blood spilling off in an arc as his head pulls back, a terrible grin creeping across his smile. As you now see, this dull gray-colored, Grog flesh-toned piece of skin dangling bloodily from his mouth. (disgusted noises) We can fix it! Your turn, currently grappled so you can't move. I would like to attempt to break that grapple.",MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.
Deception,"firework? Nope. To help me out? Will it be a team effort? No? All right. Doing this now. Oh, that's good, that's a 16. 18 total. (chuckles) As you begin casting, one of the Bastions grabs your wrist and pulls you into his face and says, ""I'm sorry, missy. Am I to understand that you're cheating?"" No! That's just the language of my people. She's foreign. Yes, I'm foreign.",MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll. It would

That's all I actually have because I had ten left, (laughs) and I take those, and I give them. I'm sorry. This has been a misunderstanding. She's foreign, and she's royalty. Please, I'm from Draconia. She's from-- she's a druid. I say all this shit really quick, and I'm like, I'm so, so sorry. I worship the ever-loving unicorn, Rainbow Fluffers.","MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage,"
Medicine,"the crowd continues cheering once again. (cheering) The clerics now come climbing down to the center of the Crucible to retrieve the unconscious and bleeding-out body of Kern, administering Heals immediately to make sure he doesn't actually slip away from everyone. I run over and grab my lip and pick it up and go, just between you and me, is there anything we can do with this? (laughter) One of the clerics looks up for a second. ""Hold it there for a moment."" And reaches out and administers a 5th-level Cure Wounds. He's making a","medicine check to see how-- well, that's a 16. You"

""No, I have it here in my ledger that you bet against your friend Grog."" Oh, he would never do that. I believe you are mistaken, actually. There must be a typo. I bet on Grog. Don't you remember? Are you casting something? Nope, I'm just doing this.",MATT: Go ahead and make a deception roll.
Survival,"What? You're in holding? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm a pretty big deal. What's going on? You were arrested? Why? Because Keyleth tried to do something, and I tried to talk her out of it and it didn't work out, and we're now in holding. It's fine. Oh, bullshit, you tried to talk me out of it. You tried to talk out what? I mean, I tried to help her out. Tiberius, what can you see around you? A guard looking at me. Can I track them?",MATT: Make a survival check.

They're actually mental patients, and they've gotten loose. Vex! Here we are! Oh! That's them, I'm afraid. ""These two cheaters over here? These are the ones you're looking for?"" Cheaters? Well, that makes sense. They don't understand normal social rules. I'm from Draconia! And I'm also... not from here. You see what I'm talking about?",MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

And he turns around and shuffles through a bunch of pieces of burlap and sacks and pulls out what looks to be an actual dried and hollowed-out hog's head. ""To fill this? To fill this hog's head with it? This'll only cost you 426 gold pieces. ""Yes?"" How about 400 even, and you can direct me to some ore, as well? ""Ore? I do not work in ore.""

You could die any given day. So could I, so could she, so could him. Maybe not him, but the rest of us, sure. Are you really interested in this?",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Persuasion,"pushes you away. He pulls out of your hands and takes a few steps away and looks over his shoulder. You can see now, there's tears welling up in his eyes.

There's what looks like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side. It looks like a bedroom that nobody's currently in. And there's no sign that this is a youth's bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from what I see in here?",MATT: Make an investigation check.

It was de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we need it re-chanted. And I thought that House Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as it seems. And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this. He takes the amulet. And not as a trade, but as a favor for just the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it.",MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

There's a channel of water between the two. I go ahead and Druidcraft a little campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for us? I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm going to see if I can do this. That sort of ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to where they wouldn't be able to see it.",MATT: Sure! Go ahead and make a stealth check.

The color blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue dragon. However, the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this is, but you do know it's probably something in the serpentine-type magical realm. I heard them, I heard them describe it. Would I know it from the description?

Perception,"cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the wood here is, you've heard previously, one of the major exports here is very high-quality timber from this type of tree that is used for very exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the quartz from the mines itself. There are people in the city, but sparse. Make a perception check. Can I also make a perception check? You may. With my eagle vision? (singsong) You may. 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight, which means",I have advantage on all perception checks.
Athletics,"And you can't talk right now, you're an eagle. I leave a little, like a canteen or something, right where she's perched, just so I know where to find her. Okay. Smart. Leave the mug. Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk down and see if I can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations. Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot wall she's perched on. Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?",MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check to
Athletics,"He's doing walla. (all laugh) One of them ends up counting the last bit of crop. ""That's it, that's all we have. That is the ""entire pull for the day."" And the older gentleman, who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes, ""Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide."" Wait, wasn't that one of the people-- ""At the very least, let's gather it together and hopefully Pelor will protect us."" And the people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of Whitestone, where you guys are currently at. Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.",MATT: All right. Make an athletics check.
Nature,"to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn us in, in hopes of saving their own necks. That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're terrified, but this whole town's being ruled by fear. I have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the psyche of the villagers here. This is true! It could help out. Let them know the god of the sun is on their side. I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree, so. Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I have a feeling.",TRAVIS: Can I make a nature check to see if that's
Religion,"Yes, we get there at sunrise, take those fucking beasts out, and you start at eight AM. But then what? We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy, because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just do the tree area, which will be like two hours, maybe. Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or two hours with it. Once the tree is healed, we have no one of religious power to summon any god. We don't know anything about this god, none of us do! I do, in theory, if I'm from--",MATT: Go ahead and roll a religion check.

Stealth,"your beard is at maximum, Grog. The fact that you even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of magic in its own right. Amazing. You would be a freak. Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial? Whip it. That's dope. Isn't that dope? Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard. Oh, natural 20 on stealth! You can forget it. I won't go in. So you guys are traveling as a group. I need",stealth checks from everybody.
Stealth,"Just like her owner. The rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids, you-- (fake coughing) I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there. Okay, so you guys look like pretty rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a little razzled. It looks like you've been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of Whitestone for quite some time-- I wanted to be a model. -- with a donkey. (goat bleat)","MATT: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks"
Deception,"Whitestone-- Oh shit. -- but you don't look like a threat, per se. So you are noticed, and some people seem to just stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make any active mention, note, or change in behavior towards it. Are we checking buildings while we're walking through? I have passive perception of 21  I'm always looking. I walk over to just one random person on the street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms? Our farm burned down!",MATT: (laughs) Make a deception roll. I'll give
Nature,"towards the center of this here. You-- You speak Giant, Grog? Yeah. You move past the center here and to the left of you, you can see the town square and there it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine beautiful tree at one time, full height was probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely, the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate  there's not a leaf on it. Can I do some sort of a check from a distance to see if I can recognize what kind of tree it is?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree? Look like it's no big deal. I know. You guys turn left, and you make your way towards the town square. And as you enter the square, looking around, you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for selling of meats and other goods, what was a small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this town-- nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar, but you know, enough to support this town-- desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time. As you get a closer look to the-- actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll",perception checks.
Investigation,"Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome? But, it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in Emon-- Think of an eight-year-old child. It was a kid, yo. Oh, it was a child? Oh, god. -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the crows. No, it was because of Emon. It was because of Emon. Yeah. So, can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"Yeah, Dust of tracelessness. Are you guys going in? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is where we're going to hole up. Okay. I kind of want to talk to the tree. Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth. The window is locked. Wait, not now. Not now. No, no, no, no, no, not yet. Let's find a place first. Let's post up first.","LIAM: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking"
Religion,"While she is down there, essentially meditating with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there anything you guys would wish to do, or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual? Well, there are options. What do we need? We have to get water, right? There was some issue about-- we don't have any water, do we? Was that an issue? I don't remember. There was some wells around. Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing the ritual to see if this is a curse over this tree?","MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check, I"
Stealth,"go to. What's the other one? The other one is called The Lady's Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis. That sounds fun. I don't know anybody there. I might! That's what I'm afraid-- they might know you, so no. So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis, is more central to the city and is partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your way through the city. I'll have you all roll",stealth checks if you could.

Perception,"glass windows, about every ten feet around this pattern, it looks like three to each side. There are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side, set astray, some have been destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room. You can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight creeps through. You can see there is on the altar a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this",distance. Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"I can probably lift that door bar from inside. You could, probably. With your help, son. Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very dramatic. Let's save that for important stuff. All right, where is the window? Which way do I go? To the right and up. There are windows shattered on both sides. They're broken a little higher up. So you could either continue to break the bottom part of the window, or just attempt to leap through the hole. Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.","MATT: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check."
Perception,"Looking about the place, it looks pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that was broken, was broken from the outside in. So, definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through, or a intrusion from an outside standpoint. As you walk further and look around, the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed. There is the altar on the top, and you do see, there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit candles, and there are some braziers. One to each side of the altar, and one against each wall. All of them appear to be long dark and out. Go",ahead and make a perception check.
Investigation,"Just a very faint glow of ember to it. What's the matter? Reynal? Who? Reynal? Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal? Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the door on the right. You step up. You can see now, on top of the altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You can see bits of broken glass across the bottom, the one step that leads down from the altar's raised platform. Can I dip and smell?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Can I dip and smell? Make an investigation check. 13. 13? Okay. Looking at just the general vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't really determine it. But, just touching it to your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear out a little bit from the scent. There is some random powders and such that've been brushed off. You get the feeling that the way that all this was treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a",perception check.
Investigation,"took in much detail. I believe his observations ""have brought me to the brink of finishing my design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within ""a couple of months to gather the components needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the ""subject is heading here.

(creak) Opens up into what was Father Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And you can see, shoved under the bed that first appears on the opposite side of the small room, what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal. Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed. Can I tell how he died? You're welcome to go ahead and take a look.",Roll an investigation check.
Perception,"various sun and stars that are set up, but most of them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or covered in soot. An intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of Pelor in this once-holy place. Are there any untouched? None that are untouched, but there are some that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small medallions that are hanging up in the room where the Father lays. I'll snag those. Okay. I want to check the other room. The room to the left.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"should we head back? We should head back. Apparently, any help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone. Should we check this other room first, before we go? Did we not check the other room? No. Let's check the other room, and-- Quickly, though, quickly. We'll check the other room quickly. While they check the room, I'm going to go all over the altar and see if there's anything, any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like that.","MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check."
Investigation,"Okay, go ahead and make a perception check. Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20. I was really hoping you missed that part. Looking over the altar, it appears to be smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your attention. You check the other room. This is a small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship and/or just cook for its own meals when the father was keeping-- Has it been used recently? Is it-- It does not appear to have been used, you",can make an investigation check to gather an idea

And he says, ""Go ahead and tell Trevor, because the rest ""of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than live in this bullshit."" What was your name, sir?

Stealth,"why. Sure. Because they haven't phoned me to tell me that we're ready to go, I will become a dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling. Okay. Meanwhile, the twins are looking at our home, sizing it up. All right. Keeping a close eye. Through the dark rainy atmosphere, you can see on both homes, the interiors are slightly lit. There appears to be individuals at home in both homes. You just can't see who it is, necessarily. There is light in the interior.

You look down and you notice, even through the storm, you can see in the distance, there's the dark shape of a giant lumbering zombie guard making its way down to this part of the town. What are you doing? So I'm on a roof that's all soaking wet, right? Yeah. There's no crawl space access? No attic I can get to?",MATT: Make a perception check.

As you run, you get over to the front of the gate that is closed off. It's a little bit too tight for you to squeeze through. How do you plan to get over the gate?

There's a door immediately to your left, and there's, across the way, is an archway opening. There's no actual door there. It's just a walkway that leads into the next room.

Split his head like a gourd. 11. 11 points of damage as Trinket latches onto the back of his shoulder (growls) and pulls and tugs at him, trying to get him loose from Grog's grip. Not strong enough to do so, but he nevertheless takes the damage and (snarls) hisses back at the bear clutched onto his shoulder. Cool. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

Athletics,"fangs get caught on the chain. (grunts) Like making out with braces. He pulls away, releases you-- no, doesn't release you. As he's holding you there, he's going to go ahead and make a claw strike across your face. Two and, oh. That'll be a 19. That does hit. He does hit? Okay. You take eight points of slashing damage, reduced to four because of your rage. That ends his turn. Grog, you're up now. Am I still grappled? You're still grappled, yeah. I'd like to try and break the grapple. Okay, so you use your action to try and",break the grapple. So athletics roll of?
Acrobatics,"The mist is there, yeah. There's a clump of mist where he once was. Somebody light a match! I'm coming! So the head disappears from his mouth, or did he still get a big taste? There's still some thick, purplish, congealed blood in his mouth, but the vampire's form has been forced to mist at zero hit points. All right, that brings us to Keyleth. Okay!

Before I do, I'm going to spank Grog as hard as I can on the ass and say, ""Kill!"" And run up the stairs at the first guy who's enveloped in Percy's smoke and start stabbing him. Okay. He's up above the banister, so you probably have to-- There's no balcony? No, the idea is the banister rides up and there's a wall along it, and then they're all up on the second floor here looking down at this. So there's no way up there?",MATT: You could leap up. Make an acrobatics check
Acrobatics,"now. They were trying to haul ass out? Nah, I'll hold. Whoever's next can go. So polite. That is really kind of you, Grog. That ends your turn. It is now the guards' turn. They all...

They all rush and leap off the balcony, try and catch themselves there.",LIAM: See those acrobatics checks...
Athletics,"11 points of damage. Across that guy. Okay. Trinket reaches out and strikes across one of the guys, the guy you Hunter's Marked, who takes the claw across the side of his head, and you hear him yell out in pain, (scream) as he makes it out into the rain. Hurt, but not taken down. He continues to run past, and they all dart outside into the rainstorm. I'll take my turn now. (laughs) Okay, Grog. I leap over the banister with my war hammer high and jump down on the guy that's closest to me, bringing it down with a reckless attack and great weapon master.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for the jump."

(zoomf) That guy is, through the back of the head, (zoomf, groan) and just slides through the mud for another two feet. And I act like I have another, that I can attack him again. I say, ""Stop!""",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Perception,"now mixed with in the rain outside. Melt with prejudice, okay. Got one guy left. Now as you guys are all gathering around, we'll say from a roleplaying standpoint, as there is no real immediate threat to you  there is one guard left, who has currently one broken ankle and one missing lower half of his left leg, on the ground, looking at you all, hyperventilating and trying to back away, like (panting). Time to call the Sandman. Since I'm outside on the threshold of the house, can I see where Scanlan might have lit up the other house yet?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Intimidation,"""Got it."" I go upstairs with Percy. That mist is probably following me around at this point, isn't it? The black smoke, you mean? Yeah. Oh, yeah. The black smoke is slowly trailing behind you. With each step you take, it licks the back of your boots. Oh, boy. Okay. Is there anything else you can tell me in regards to back doors or secrets that your bosses don't want us to know? I mean, really, this is the time to talk, right now. Anything you use to identify each other?",MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation check.
Perception,"people from the Sun Tree? ""Yeah, as a warning."" ""Where I saw that child?"" I slit his throat. (extended choking sounds) With a wet gurgle, the life expires from his body, a pool beginning to form on the tile below him. Nicely done, Vax. Piece of shit. So Percy and I are upstairs alone? Yes. Can I check his body? (laughs) You begin rummaging through the body. You're keeping an eye out. Make another",perception check.
Insight,"body. You're keeping an eye out. Make another perception check. I go upstairs, and I get Percy up against a wall. I turn around and slam him against a wall. Okay. This is sexy. 27. And I look him straight in the eye-- And kiss him. And I say, ""Are you all right?"" I think so. Look me in the eye, Percy. I feel cruel, but in control. This is controllable, at the moment.","LAURA: ""All right."" I'm insight-checking him."
Investigation,"de Rolo family crest in the smoke. Okay. You begin to take the plume of smoke and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make the smoke go to a thicker, thicker black and take the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air until eventually we have a very well-defined de Rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of Whitestone. Oh! Something's happening! Something's happening in the sky! That's me. I think it's a magic wielder of some sort. Something-- I must flee! (laughter)",MATT: All right. Investigation checks from both of
Perception,"pretty bland, with a staircase that leads down into what was once servants' quarters that has been converted into a torture room. Oh, lovely. It's a little nicer in its presentation and tools than the duergar torture room that you encountered in the Underdark, but this looks to be like Tylieri had a definite interest in entertaining unwanted guests. Okay. Vax or Vex, will you come check this hatch for boobies? (laughter) I jog on down.","MATT: All right, make a perception check."
Perception,"corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up, and there is a dark box. Um. About eight feet long. I hear him say ""Um,"" and I jump down, too. With the Flametongue dagger out for light. Okay. The room lights up a little bit and you can see across the way there is a not super-detailed, but a fairly well-crafted coffin on the opposite side of the room. Ooh! I bet there's treasure in there! You might be right. Yeah, let's go have a look. Is there treasure? Did you find treasure?","LIAM: ""Hold, please."" Perception check the coffin."
Investigation,"velvet material, the smell quickly fades. It looks like there are some small baubles in there, keepsakes. There is what looks to be a cape or a cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for comfort. Roll it up. Put it into my satchel. I'm going to take a dagger out and I want to cut all the way up through that purple velvet. Just see, just in case. Okay. You cut through the purple velvet. Rummage through underneath. It appears to be the back of the box. I'm going to check his desk upstairs for anything interesting.",MATT: Okay. Want to make an investigation check?
Perception,"make your way to the front of the building. The doors are closed and locked. The alcove? Closed and locked? I'll see about that. I'm going to check the door. Go for it. That is ten. 23. Okay. Seems to be a fairly simple lock. All right. Look for an ambush around. Can we look around? Yeah, perceive it? Rooftops? Sides of the building?","MATT: Make a perception check, guys."
Persuasion,"They're right on the inside. I thought it was upstairs, or you said right on the other side of the door? Right on the other side of the door. Oh, for crying out loud. I push past them I just go, Jordana! Jordana, it's us! Okay, there's a pause and a voice goes, ""Who's us?"" Oh. Crazy grandma! And Vox Machina. (quietly) Does she know we're called that? No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy grandma was staying with you. Crazy peasants. Allies.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Insight,"We also, somebody-- there's the point that somebody is informing on us. Someone is informing on us. What are you talking about, why? They were ready for us. They knew we were coming. Of course they knew we were coming, we killed one of their-- They said there was an informant. They said that there was an informant when we were there. Who did? That guard. He said our contacts were right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is informing on us. It could be you.",LIAM: I insight-check this woman.
Athletics,"No. Keyleth, we've got to go. I say we let her hit them, and we run. Scanlan, can you drop the fog just a bit? Nope, not by magic. He can't control it. It's on the ground. You can probably see above it. Fog is low. Well, the fog this creates is a magical fog that obscures an entire area. If you climbed to the very top of the tree, you might be able to get a little bit of a visual. All right, I'm going to climb as high as I can.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check."
Athletics,"I'm running back. I'm going back towards the skeletons. I was carrying you. You're on Trinket with me, aren't you? Can he carry both of us? No, I was pulling her by the arm. I break from Vax's grasp and start running back Go ahead and make-- this is technically breaking a grapple. I do want to trail back a little on Trinket and try to cast Conjure Barrage as we're running. Okay, so, so Trinket begins to turn around. You're fighting. It would be either acrobatics or athletics versus your athletics.","MARISHA: Athletics. Ooh, I rolled an 18."
Perception,"precarious, but not too much to really bother you guys. You get to the top and you look over and you see this sea of thrashing about skeletal entities, some looking fresher than others, and all intent on trying to find some way-- and you start to see some of them starting to climb up over each other to get to the height of the wall. I'm just going to hold and anybody who gets too close-- I'm just going to take a shot at anything that gets too close. Okay. Can you see any giants from up there? Can I see any giants from up there?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"wow. 16. Yeah. (laughs) General saves on this. I'm rolling for shit. Yeah, you are! All right, so with that (blast) the shock wave blasts outward, and you see skeletons being thrown-- pieces of skeletons. Arms and weapons and pieces of shield and armor being flung in the air. As you see 12 of them immediately disintegrate and explode around it. In that moment, though, the horde pushes again and fills that gap almost instantly. You do see the end of it now, at this point. It looks to be probably a total of 65 left",in this section. Roll a perception check.
Athletics,"do you guys want to do? Ladies first. Can I jump off of the wall? You can. Into the group?! You can, yeah. Yeah. I can? Okay. I want to try... I want to see what happens if I cast Turn Undead. Or Destroy Undead. You have access to both. Oh man. Okay. It's a 30-foot radius. Let's do it. I want to see it. I want to see what it does. All right, so I need you to go ahead and",make an athletics check to see how far you can
Athletics,"She killed 36 of them! It hurts at impact, and you feel like the bone wobbled as the skull (bone ratchety noise) back towards you. This symbol does nothing for me. I'm here to soak up damage for you, Pike. Let them hit me in the face. It looks great. Good craftsmanship. But well done, that was a fun round. That was a test. It's better now than against Sylas Briarwood. (laughs) True enough. Can I make it around the wall?",MATT: If you want to make an athletics check to

Go ahead and roll damage. Ten... 14. 14, doubled due to the bludgeoning vulnerability on the initial impact. The hammer slams into its rib cage, causing it to cave inward.

What time is it right now? Right now? It's hard to tell. Hopefully, it's a while until dawn. It's about two hours past sunset. Oh, good. We've got time! That's good. I pull out my Flametongue dagger and just look in two or three graves. I don't know if there's anything in there. Are you trying to grave rob right now?",MATT: Make an investigation check.

So you leap down into the grave, drop, your feet hitting against the wooden bottom of the coffin. Smells musty and it's been rained in heavily, so it's not as bad as it could be. It looks to be a pretty dagger. You reach for it and pick it up and look at it, it's lightweight, it's ornamental, it's not actually more of a functional--",LIAM: I want to make an arcana check.

Did they blow it? Does it look like a cave-in, like somebody did it on purpose?",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this is

That's where you guys came through. Yeah? And see this path here? Yeah. And here. And there are cells on this side. Is there anything good in the storage room that we're in? Oh, you're in the storage room? Yeah.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"besides that in this room? From what you can tell, no. There's no dim light or anything? The only dim light is coming from around that corner, from the source of where that sound seemed to come. Okay. I should be able to see, then, if there's dim light. Up to 60 feet. Right. Nothing immediately in your visual perspective. If you go all the way to the edge, you can look past the corner if you want. Okay. I slowly back up away from that and creep up the hall and stop at the corner before it turns and I just lean my head out and I listen.",MATT: Okay. Perception check.
Insight,"the village. Everyone we can. Do all of you step forward at this point, or is it just you? Just him. Mr. High Charisma. I am not alone. I have friends with me. Some of whom look quite scary, so don't be alarmed if a bear stands right behind me. ""A bear?"" It's a good bear. It's the best kind of bear. He's the cutest. ""Who is that?"" That's my friend Vex. Vex, come forward. I walk up a little bit behind Scanlan and I",insight check her to see what
Arcana,"""terrible cell."" She kind of looks about. Has anybody been coming down and feeding you? ""Every now and then."" Not on a regular basis? ""Every day or so they bring enough to subsist on."" As she's talking, I'm going to see if there's any sort of arcana or magical incantation on her, or any sort of possession. Is that something I can check for? Do you have the Detect Magic spell? No. I do.","SAM: Can I just do an arcana check, or is that"
Intimidation,"He was the first one out of the light. Right, but everyone else is still in the shadow, all these voices coming at her. She can see me because I went down towards Scanlan. Okay. She steps a little closer to you as you're holding the whip out, and she grabs your hand with her left hand and kind of pulls it in and goes, ""Please. Don't leave me here. I can fend ""for my own. Just don't leave me here."" I step forward now behind Scanlan. Super fucking intimidating. If things go well upstairs, we'll be back. If when we leave, you make a peep, you won't ever again.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Perception,"No no no, there's something, I don't know what, I couldn't make out what I was hearing, it sounded like hay or grass moving, so I don't want to mess with that. Someone's sleeping. I think it was the straw on the bottom of her cell, right? No, that was her passage. There's another passage to presumably another set of cells. So I will skip along quietly 20 feet ahead of you all. Try to see. Old people love us. We're the worst. You skitter around the corner. Go ahead and",make a perception check.
Perception,"very hard. I'm putting on a show for her. Oh, this is a really difficult lock. Okay, as you're going for the lock, she rushes up and helps you with it and is holding, like, ""Yes, yes, please, just like that. All right."" And then what? ""You turn it this way. You don't have the proper tools for this--"" I snap the thing into the lock. Oh no. I knew I shouldn't have done that. ""Foolish girl!"" I just don't know what I'm doing, but I will be back with someone who does.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Intimidation,"You very much recognize her. You do notice, by the way, her right hand? The sleeve ends. There is no hand there. It is just a missing hand, and the left hand is visible. As far as we can see, unarmed? Right? Yeah. Anna? ""Yes?"" Let's be frank with each other. You have either you are going to die in this cell-- and I promise you, you will die in this cell-- or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't. So I would start talking right now or I swear we will not leave this dungeon before you're dead.",MATT: Roll an intimidation check.
Insight,"She says, ""Well, for one thing, I've been here with them for the past five years. I helped them ""reestablish their current social control of this city when they left it a pile of flames and ""rubble. And their little experiment beneath the castle? ""I was one of their chief scientific designers."" Tell us about the experiments beneath the castle. (chuckles) ""You'll have to ask Sylas or Delilah for that. I don't have all the details or ""the reasons behind it, other than the process I was brought in to construct."" Can I see if she's lying?",MATT: You can. Make an insight check.
Perception,"(laughter) And just put it gently at her back, going, nothing personal. I'm just feeling a bit nervous. ""Understood."" She straightens up a little more and continues walking ever so carefully. Not quite leaning her head or making too many large movements, but definitely still keeping a seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere is. I creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if I can hear anything on the other side. You don't hear anything inside the room.",Roll a perception check.
Perception,"Okay. You two coast up to the glass and look out, and another cloud-covered, slightly drizzly morning has taken the caldera between the mountains that houses Whitestone in this forest. You can see the entire city of Whitestone down below this elevated part of topography. What you do see, one, are large plumes of smoke, about six or seven of them, all gathered towards what you can tell now is the north side of the city, which is the closest to you. You guys are on the southwest side of the castle, based on the spatial awareness you've now made. Where the more upper-class folk would live, I'm assuming?","MATT: Go ahead and roll perception check, while"
Stealth,"Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the arm and say, ""Listen to me--"" (creaking) What is that? Pizza. Forget I said that. Listen to me, I do not have a good feeling about this. And I start to undo the cloak that's on me, And I want you to wear this. And I tie an elven cloak. Shut up, please. I don't need it. You will wear this. You will stay hidden when it is needed. You almost lost me. I almost lost you. You will wear this as needed. I will wear it. Thank you. I walk out ahead of her. Pull the hood up. So you get advantage on",stealth checks. As you guys step into the hallway
Persuasion,"Ability on you. For charisma. I don't need it. Well, you do now. Has it worn off? It lasts for a minute, so yeah, it's worn off. Oh, it only lasts for a minute? Friends only lasts for a minute. I had enhance charisma on for a while, but now it's gone, so if you do it, what I had is gone-- Pour some sugar on, Keyleth. I'll do it. I'm going to enhance. In case we get busted. So you'll have advantage on",persuasion rolls.
Investigation,"unhurt. Yeah, Grog! Grog with the steal. Ooh, I get a piece of paper! Shit, Potion of Flying. This is awesome. All right, do you have your shit? Can we get out of here? ""Yes. Everything else here is of no interest to me."" She kicks one of the drums on the way out. Slips back into the hallway. Anything you could use, Percival? Was there any more black powder? I've taken all of her ammunition and black powder, I suppose. Anything else that looks useful to me?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Okay. You glance about the room. It's lived in. The actual bed covers themselves are pulled off. You can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet in the far corner. It's all put away. The chair's open a little, like it was stepped out of. The room is absent of anyone. I walk over to the closet. I open it. Okay. You open the closet. She has outfits there. Many of them don't appear to have been worn in a while. Looking for signs of life with the paper on the desk. You search her desk? Yes.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"She begins making her way towards the landing that leads to the stairway down, whereas you stealth off in that direction. You find your way around that corner. Go ahead and roll perception. As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap and put it on, and I also whip out this other cloak that I've been looking at and whip it around. You're not here. And now continue on. All right. So both will attune to you at your next short rest. Yes, all right, excellent. It's fine. Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before. There's two things. Moving forward.","MATT: All right, make a perception check."
Athletics,"calling of Jenga. So go for it. I'll cast it-- no, I'm just going to keep it at 1st level for now. I'm going to save my higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my spellcaster. Three. That's not too bad. No, sorry. 16? No, 13. 13? Okay, good to know. All righty. That's your turn. Vex, you're up. So I'm with Anna. Trinket-- I tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us. Okay. So he clamps down on her arm. So one, two. He's going to attempt to",grapple her. Go ahead and roll an athletics check
Acrobatics,"Okay. So I saw him go down. Yes. Does it look like he's awake now to me? I'm mean, it was all happening very quickly. You have no idea. This all happens very quickly. You just saw your brother take a huge-- I scream and I run towards him. Okay. I slide down on my knees and slide across the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute-- or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him. You won't get close enough to do it, unfortunately. If I slide down and slide?",MATT: Make an acrobatics check. For this
Athletics,"the study. You reach out and your hands meet his form, stopping you in the process just as the surge of healing energy jolts through his body. So you can go ahead and cast it on him. Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd level. So that's 3d8. Where are my d8s? That was the worst roll! Nine! So you heal nine hit points. That's good. That's okay, because I slid to you. It was amazing. I'll never forget it. (laughs) Okay, that's your turn. Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her. Forward? Okay. That ends your turn. All","right, go ahead and roll an athletics check for"
Medicine,"right? Because of the shield and the armor. 18. 18 points of damage? With that, the second arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor. It hits some sort of core where its arcane form is held and the reddish energy blinks out, and the armor just (impact noise) crumples to the ground. That's two of them! What's up, bitches? That was tough. Okay, I immediately turn my attention to Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make sure she's okay?","MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check, yeah."

I start running out the hall to Ripley. Me, as well. Oh, Trinket is still running after her, too.","MATT: All right, make a perception check for"
Medicine,"can. Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage because he's got advantage on smell perception. Oh, it's the same thing. Okay, so Trinket is keeping track, but is having a hard time fully keeping up at this point unless you're giving full attention towards him at this point in time, but is keeping a track. He is rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is currently out of your sphere of personal influence at the moment. I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs) I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off after her out the door.",MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on a medicine check.
Perception,"she looks up and touches your hair and goes, ""I see ""we've both survived quite a bit."" I wouldn't trade. She laughs to herself, and you see another tear curl at her eye, and then her face goes cold for a second and she, not breaking this gaze, steps back. ""You shouldn't be here. They were ""using me to get to you. I'm so sorry."" Are you all right? Did they do anything? Are you yourself? She reaches up and holds her neck. ""I'm good. I'm good."" And she steels herself for a second, and even more so, you see there's an intensity to her.",TALIESIN: Perception check?
Perception,"our goals are aligned to free this city, let's do ""it together. But I don't have to listen to you."" God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh! She walks out of the room. Percy! She's so obnoxious. What? You have a sister. Oh god, I do. You guys, charging off. Trinket's keeping trail. She's run down the stairway, he is beginning to slowly gain on her. She reaches the front doors, does remember the caltrops. Jumps over them, grabs the door, opens it, and rushes out into the daylight. Go ahead and roll a",perception check for Trinket.
Investigation,"what's on him. Like, his head bits? I don't want any of him sticking around. Do we have to put him in the Bag of Holding, though? Why can't we just set him on fire? Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something for now. Fire will do. Is there a fireplace in the room? There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll throw him in the fire. Wait. Let me see what's on him, first.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"I'll look with Scanlan. 12. He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap some joints. 27. Okay, good. As you're looking through and finding papers, papers and ledgers and tough discussions of old classes, untouched on the side, you go through one of the bottom drawers, and there's a lock to it. Well, let's unlock that. Vax, do you need my help to unlock it? No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps in there?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"Is that your sister? Apparently. She's currently now dressed in armor you've seen as ornamental before. It was armor that your mother trained in when she was young, but was unused for a long time. It seems to be serviceable  it's been updated and such. She slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side, and her hair is pulled back and tied off, and she looks at the rest of the room. ""So are we ready?"" Let me see your neck. She steps up and lifts her chin up towards you. By the way, this is Grog.",LIAM: I'm going to insight check as he does that.
Athletics,"doesn't mess with anything fancy or unnecessary. The ammunition she does have are made specific to size to her pistol. They will not function for the Pepperbox, unfortunately. They will only work for the pistol. Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm doing okay. It does act as a pistol for rules-wise, which is on your sheet here, so yes, you would have that. Do you want it? Just in case yours misfires? I'll steal it back from him if I need, but it should be fine.",SAM: I'd like to make an athletics check.
Athletics,"Yeah, we took out the ammunition. Okay, now give me a bullet. Maybe don't do that. I hand him the ammunition. I load four of them. Yeah! Giving him a loaded gun? I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But I'm a little big boy. I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab it out of his hand. I will prevent him from doing that! Okay. You guys are fighting over a loaded gun.",MATT: Sleight-of-hand check. Athletics check.

Insight,"17! Shut up. 27. As you go to be, ""No, what are you--"" It's already gone. You don't even know where it went, you didn't see him take it, you just all of a sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you. And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra? ""Yes."" I was at the door. He had a knife to your throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What did he want you to say?

Insight,"could be a puppet. Can I try this? This is a long shot. My-- actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves. We're immune to charm effects. Or we have resistance. Resistant to it. Advantage against saves. Since we have that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a charm? Your resistance doesn't make you attuned to it. Unfortunately, it's just a natural ability that's inherent. Her being human, there's not a way to really correlate with that. I mean, you've","read over her a few times, doing insight checks."
Perception,"there is about a 15, 20-foot wide and about a ten to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall. And the closer you get, you see large piles of dirt that fill one side of the room were put off to the side as if pieces of this dig were discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the ground that appears to have not been very well cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and out of this area. You also see, as you push two-thirds into the room, broken pieces of whitestone that had been carved into what looks like parts of walls or pillars. Support things that failed in their construction and just broke and were tossed and discarded to the side. Make a",perception check.
Nature,"I don't remember. It wasn't very good. Okay. 13. Okay. Those of you with about 25 or above, you glance and you find two of these slivers of this material you don't recognize and part of this broken stone. It's like a dark green glass. About a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers. You only find a small scattering few, and it has a grainy texture to it, and you take a look at it, and it's transparent. You can see shapes through it, but it's opaque enough to the point where it distorts a little bit of the visual and color behind it.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on this? Is this
Arcana,"Can I do a nature check on this? Is this similar to the broken glass that I collected before? Which broken glass you collected before? I don't know. I just have broken glass shards. I feel like that was the red stones or something from before. I feel like there was some sort of-- There was that sea of glass. Yeah, we were in some cavern. Oh, the sea of bone and glass? Okay. Yeah, it is not similar to that, no. However, those who are trained in arcana, you can go ahead and make",an arcana roll.
Nature,"Negative two. You would have filled in, if you have a proficiency. The dot? The dot. Oh. Oh. 11. You have really no idea what this glass is. I grab it back. Okay. That was just me?

Survival,"It appears to be, or naturally occurred, and the structure of it has this bumpy, wavy-- it's not like smooth glass. Like when lightning hits sand? Kind of. But you're not sure what it actually is. I wonder if this was holding that acid. I wonder if something very, very hot... I'm wondering if it's a symptom of something. When they burn the whitestone with the acid or something? Do I see any recent tracks around here? Does it look like people came down here?",MATT: Make a survival check with advantage because
Perception,"It looks like there's some tracks here, but I don't know what it's saying. Grog, you immediately see a cluster of recent footprints, probably a day old at most, that lead in towards the tunnel. Looks like the prints are of seven individuals. Feet are fairly wide, masculine and heavy in step. One gait appears to be smaller, thinner, and more feminine. How many tombs are open around us? Eight total in this room. Should we check the tombs? They're already open and empty. They're open and empty.",MATT: You all make a perception check.
Religion,"the gun. Daggers out. Go ahead and make your two attacks against him. No sneak attack damage. The first was a 13. The second was a 22. Pretty sure the 22 hits. 22 hits. Okay. Go ahead and roll damage against Percy. Eight. All right, so you take eight points of piercing damage. You feel the blade (pained cry) pierce into the side.

Athletics,"a quarter-mile south of you. So probably not under the Sun Tree. Currently, no. Okay. Walking up to the door, does it look like I can get any purchase with my little finger-bits? Nope. It is flush with the ground. I have a pickaxe that I picked up before we left. Okay. Can I swing it at the bottom and try and find some purchase under the door? You could try. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and",roll an athletics check to see if you can manage
Perception,"No, maybe if we all think about the strength of our friendship and bond together. This is our time now! Hold on, as much as I love Pike, you aren't a real person right now. Maybe we should swap out Pike. Yeah, Pike, as you pull your hand away, the stone is glowing. And it fades momentarily after you put your hand there. Oh, it does work. Never mind, Pike. I love you. But are there any on the ceiling? Nothing on the ceiling. Do we see any missing ones?",MATT: Roll a perception check.
Perception,"Oh, is this your room? I didn't even realize we were in your house right now. How good to see you again, darling. Sylas leans forward and puts his hand to the glass and says, ""And hello to you, too. And ""welcome to all of you. Well, my dear."" At which point Delilah steps forward and goes, ""I was hoping for a more formal reunion, but you ""insisted on riling up the populace and tying up the bulk of our forces. ""Rather unfortunate, really."" Now, the door's open behind them, right? If I use perception, do I see anything behind them, any switch or lever or anything?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah. That was quite a ways away. Oh, damn it. Okay. It's probably a mile behind you. Pike, is there any way you can get through this stone wall to the other side to see what's there? Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do it? Oh no, we can't hear you. Hold on, we can't hear you. The darkness is consuming her. Oh no, she's muted. Hanging up and calling you back.",MATT: Roll a perception check.

I am having some fabulous dark chocolate right now. It is so good. They're feeding it to me. Can we hear you, Ashley? There we go. Four. Okay. Okay.","MATT: Pike, roll a perception check."
Stealth,"I think we should, because as far as they know, we're dead now. They don't know we got out of there. It's true. Okay. So everyone go ahead and roll stealth. Oh my god. Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. I still critical failed. Wait, can't you roll again now that I told you we were casting-- (laughs) Nah. It stays, unfortunately. Doesn't work that way?","MATT: All right, so, stealth rolls, plus ten to"
Perception,"whitestone you've seen used in the construction and all of the mining materials here within the city, but from what little light you have in the room-- and there is a little bit of ambient light from torches set at different points, and those who can see decently at a distance, and there is an ominous glow to the structure itself-- it gradually turns to a greenish color. Hard to see exactly why this transition is, but it goes from white to a green towards the top, and it levels off. You can see what looks to be a small separate structure at the very top. There are long stairways that are visible on the two sides you long stairways.",Everyone make a perception check.
Deception,"instinctively and look down at her with a look of ""What are you doing?"" You reach forward and reach out your hands against him. Let me check Restoration real fast. Let me see here, Greater Restoration. 5th level. Ends effects like charmed or petrified. As you reach out and touch him you feel the impact of the Briarwoods' influence fade from your mind. As she touches you, the charm is dispelled and you look at your daggers and look where you are and look at the moments and the last few minutes and you're like-- Then can I look up and stay in a defensive stance and back towards Lady Briarwood? Oh, feigning?","MATT: You know what, make a deception check."
Stealth,"above you pull back your arrow and inciting the magical enchantment of the bow, you release and as it does it (crack crack) crackles with energy and splits into three separate arrows that arc around each other almost like a helix of DNA. As they all streak downward they (impact noises) slam into Sylas from the other side him now being assaulted on all fronts. I use my bonus action to hide again. Okay. Well you're still out in plain sight. Unless you're pulling way, way back. If you want to pull back towards the shadow. I want to hide. Okay. So you pull further and further away",from it. Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Perception,"15, 16, 17. 22. Okay, you resist the effects of the blade now, having saved from it. That ends your turn. At the end of your turn, Sylas is going to go ahead and spend one of his legendary actions to get a free movement without provoking attacks of opportunity and shift up with an amazing speed to the other side of both. As soon as you rush over to Grog he appears up in front of you grinning with his blade at the ready, right next to you and Grog. That ends your turn. It's now Cassandra's turn.

Perception,"Advantage, because I'm a half elf. I don't need anything because I'm a half-elf. Is she blinded? It didn't work. Is she trying to charm me or hold me? Nope! Trying to disintegrate me to death? She looks over to you and mutters under her breath (foreign word). It's a phrase you've never heard before, but as soon as it happens-- As soon as she does that-- do I see this? You're just around the side of this. I do not see it. You glance around the side for",three-quarters cover. Roll a perception check.
Perception,"orb, about a foot in diameter, that's resting in the center of this upper platform. Can I take a potion really fast? At the top of your turn, you can, as a bonus action. The orb is floating? The dark orb in the center of the platform that she's currently on in the center of this room. It's half-embedded in the ground, and she scatters her blood across it. You can see her shaking with fear and trepidation during this whole circumstance. She splatters her blood on the dark sphere?","MATT: Make a perception check, those who are up"

You don't know. I'm going to circle around to her right now. You're not going to try to heal me? No, I know. Oh, shit. You're not going to heal me? Yes, I am. Fuck that. Can I jump down, then? I'm feeding a potion to my sister.",MATT: Acrobatics check?
Acrobatics,"I'm feeding a potion to my sister. Acrobatics check? Thank you. 18. 18, okay. You land and take ten points of damage from the fall. All right. Trinket's at the door going, (sad bear noises). Trinket's trying to get in on this side. All right, Percy's gone. Scanlan, do you want to try anything? I can move within 30 feet of Vax? You'd have to get on the ground to do it. All right.","MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check, yeah."
Acrobatics,"Oh, that's right. Never mind. They would come down to meet you. Have I reached the top? We'll say now you've managed to climb up towards the top. I want to pick up Pike under my arm like a fucking football and run forward after my sister. You grab her and bolt off the side. Once we hit the ground-- we're outside of the room, right? Should we try to heal her? I've got a common. There's going to be 14 points of fall damage to you as you land because right now you're not carefully landing. This is just clutching her and","jumping off. You, make an acrobatics check."
Arcana,"Three times. Yeah, so with that, as you're carrying her there, there's a moment where all of a sudden, Vex's eyes open and (deep breath). Vex is sitting there, looking around, confused, catching her breath in Grog's arms as he's bolting down the steps of the ziggurat. Grog, you smell terrible. (chuckles weakly) Maybe we should get out of here. Do something to that little ball. I'm alone with the little ball, aren't I? Okay, I'm going to go up to it. Can I tell any type of magical properties from it from looking at it?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Medicine,"force of it, part of the wound was cauterized, but she has been bleeding quite a bit on the run down here, and she would probably need some sort of-- Should I stabilize her? Yeah, wait, stabilize her first. We're away from the fucking sacrifice area. Maybe we should just kill her. I want to quickly check my gun. Is Lord Briarwood's name still on it? You go and inspect the barrel. No. Sylas Briarwood is currently erased from the barrel. Let's hold off just a bit before we kill her. I have some really dirty rags.

I think we're just going to throw her into the acid pits. No, I don't feel... What's the plan here, Percy? I pick up the Pepperbox off the floor to give it to him, and I try to sneak out a bullet.

You mentioned just now that you wanted your money back. Was this a dream? Did you pay somebody? And with what? It was a dream where I was offered a means to revenge. It was a dream!

As it does, you can see the creature (howling groan) shrinks away from it, and its smoke actually dissipates, lowering its armor class again. Oh, that's a good move! All right. Are you going to stay where you are, or are you going to move? I'll take another step back. Okay. That's good. All right. With that... Okay. There's a momentary whisper in the shadow around you. And the sound of chains. I want everyone to make a",perception check.
Stealth,"It was a 20. 21 for the second. Nice. 42 points of damage this round. These arrows now find their way towards the cracks that are starting to appear in its chest and as each one strikes in, these arrows are actually visibly staying in its body. What was once this amorphous smoke, after the impacts from Grog and as it begins to wear itself down, it's starting to find it harder and harder to keep this ethereal form, so now these arrows are sticking out of these cracks of purplish, glowing energy and it's moving a little more sluggishly.

The cloak itself looked like cloth at a distance. Close up, you can see it's actually a very fine dark black/purple fur, and down at the side of it, you see dangling these two long tentacles that end in these little cupping spiked elements.

Cassandra's name is still on the barrel, and so is Ripley's.",Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Insight,"Well, I'm sure they don't know that the Briarwoods are dead. So perhaps if we tell everyone the Briarwoods are dead. Cassandra? Maybe we'll see Ripley on the way out. Wouldn't that be nice?

However, she has been known ""to carry a quiver or two, and this one here wields a blade as long as his body."" The Briarwoods are broken and gone.

So, as you take some time, first off, I want",you to go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Persuasion,"Well, I believe in you. And I need you for a very important commission. A great good has been done here by the rebels, by the townspeople, with the help of Vox Machina and of course, with the help of Vox Machina's leader, myself. Therefore, I'm here to commission a humble portrait of myself. You may not know him, but there was a folk hero in my town growing up. His name was Fabio. He would frequently pose with windblown hair and an open shirt on a horse. I was thinking something like that, and also I have this figure of Pike. She's a friend of mine.

You can see he's looking forward to hopefully this as much as you are, but he still has a battle to do himself.

Somebody in the crowd.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Intimidation,"Six. It's that sword's influence. Yeah, it's laughing in the Bag of Holding.

You take aspects of whitestone and residuum dust as well as residuum glass and begin to reconstruct it, based on its elements, in a much more refined, in a much more Percival-practiced method. You attach the fifth barrel, the one that you intend to be used to deliver short-range explosives, and it seems to fit together. Okay. It's nothing fancy, and a little part of you goes like, it's rattling a little when you shake it in your hand. Can I give it a once-over?","MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check. No,"

And he looks over at you and goes, ""You're Vox Machina. You're not allowed in here, and I'd like to know your business, please.""

Dr. Dranzel, and I want to know if you're really a doctor later, but I think, perhaps, maybe there's a little tidbit of information about this that you're holding back with because-- I would understand.

We could be-- I'm trying to see if this works.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.

Insight,"house, if you want me to break us into the house, which I can certainly do, I really need to know a little bit more.

I walk up by my sister, and where the woman just wiped that away, I take a piece of chalk out of my pocket and write thieves' cant-- not the word ""thieves' cant""-- I use the thieves' cant on there is a threat here.

So that's a 23. Okay. You seem to slip in. And there are two individuals currently running the kitchen. There's the smell of food, but there are no meals currently being cooked. They're just talking to each other. They don't even notice you slip by. I put my hood up before I head back that way.",MATT: Go for it. Make a stealth check?
Stealth,"""You're picking the song, mates!"" Then you see two folks come out. One's an older woman, wrinkled face, hair's a bit tattered, but she seems happy and smiling amongst her-- happy lines are all throughout her face. The other one's a younger guy. Probably, looking at the features, related to her, who's helping her out in the kitchen. And they both step out, confounded. ""What's going on?"" ""Well yes, what's going on?"" Just pick us a song, any song! Everyone, give a round of applause to your cooks for the evening! I grab Keyleth and we slip behind them and into the kitchen.",MATT: All right. Stealth checks from both of you
Stealth,"you to make an ode to the kitchen staff. Could you call the kitchen staff out and-- I did already! I did already! You called the kitchen staff out? Yes! They're the ones who are suggesting the song! Oh, really? We've just been in-- in the back-- in that downstairs room where we didn't know!? Well, we're in a separate room! Yep! There you go! (chuckles) Good thought! I had the same one! Everybody else: come now, come now, come now. All right, so you guys head down. Make",stealth checks for both of you. That's going to be
Stealth,"quickly. And there is this similar hatch that you guys have come through before. It's about five by five foot wide. I check for traps. Check for traps. Go for it. So mayhaps with the bear entering, there is enough of a distraction for one suit of armor to clankily make its way down? You would think. You guys were caught in the attention with Trinket, at the same time. So you guys were in the middle of the fray, as you were walking past. As you're bringing Trinket out, the attention is pulled away. I want you guys to make another",stealth check.
Deception,"the kitchen, you hear the voice of one of the staff, ""Excuse me! Excuse me! You can't be back here! This is our kitchen, we're trying--"" I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up! Yeah, she had a lot to drink! I've had so much to drink! You had a lot to drink, be careful. Yeah, she's going to spew! ""Take it outside! Don't do it in our kitchen!"" I need a pan, or something! She's got infectious diseases too! When she spews, everybody catches it! I have the consumption.","MATT: Pike, make a deception check. (chuckles)"
Performance,"you can see her face starting to go red. But she's determined on this, and she continues pushing this into an improvisational flurry of notes that completely walks around your performance, previously done. And you find yourself having to take a step back as she begins stepping up onto the table. And now, even at her gnomish height, is looking over the entire crowd, as people-- who were not previously as interested-- are starting to turn around and look towards you two play. I can't be one-upped. I use Minor Illusion to create sort of a mirror image of myself, over myself, also playing the flute. (laughter)","MATT: Make another performance check, with"
Stealth,"flute playing begins to pull back, as you begin to step up onto the same table next to her. Twice as high now, with the illusionary Scanlan above you, almost like those awkward middle school superimposed photos of yourself in the upper corner. And lasers in the background? Yeah! As the music swells, and the drums start picking up, you see Dranzel has now pulled up his violin and he's now furiously fiddling along with it. The music swells and swells. The guy in the kitchen who is looking for you guys hears this, and now turns his head and goes, ""What's going on?"" And looks back into the room.","Guys, make one more stealth check."

Performance,"Okay. What did you get? 18. Maybe he'll think it's cymbals or something. Best two out of three, you make your way in. (laughter) Thanks to the music, the clanking is over-- How about I pick up Pike with my 20, and I carry her in. Sure! Still works out. Minimal clank. Plank. Hold your abs. So, as the music picks up and swells, at","this point, make one final performance check."
Performance,"Blowing at each other. Eyes locked, tapping your feet heavily against the actual wood to the table. The rhythmic pounding of your feet and the drums-- because the entire room now also slamming their tables in with it as the music builds and builds until eventually you both take one deep breath and go for that same sustained note a second time. She's challenging you at the game she lost last time, and the two of you both swell into this cacophonous spray of music that hits this one final note that pierces through and all the slamming stops, and everyone just waits to hear how long it will go. It carries and carries and carries. The breath never seems to",end. Roll another performance roll.
Stealth,"""That's a lot of coin."" I get around a lot. ""Perhaps we'll have a drink later."" And she steps off the table. Now the rest of you have all made your way down into the storage chamber. Oh god. Anything we encounter is far easier than what just happened. Do you want to cry? Because I would want to cry. Money means nothing to me. Should somebody pickpocket her? Fuck yeah, man. Are you going to join them? Yes, of course!",MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Perception,"Yes, of course! Go ahead and make a stealth check. Oh, wait. Oh yes, I still have to sneak back there, don't I? I just go invisible. All right, you step under one of the nearby tables and come out, completely invisible. You make your way, stepping through the kitchen, downstairs and find that you currently, right now-- Vax, you are going to unlock the latch, you said? I'm sorry, I was just thinking of Wendydoodle's art from the comic. Yeah, yeah, I'm going to check that door for traps, is what I'm going to do.","MATT: All right, perception check. Wait, you"
Acrobatics,"part of this exit was destroyed. It has been reconstructed and there at the bottom of the stairway is a thick wooden door, wrapped in iron bars or strips of iron to keep it nice and taut and strong, and you can immediately see five locks down the side of the door. Everybody hold up for a second, could we crowd-surf the bard up to us at the front please? Oh, is that me? The bard, yes. Grog, toss me forward. Not really getting his meaning, I grab him by the back of the shirt and I just chuck him. Being at the bottom of a stairway, I want",you to make an acrobatics check.
Perception,"get up. Thanks Grog, thanks. I'm gonna scoop a hand under his head and give him a slap on both sides. (huffs) What are we looking at? Listen to me. I'm gonna try to do the talking in here, because I know these people a little. But if that fails, I need you. All right? You-- me? Yes, just do my thing? I need you on ice for a little while, all right, so just stay between me and my sister. Okay. Yes, yes, sir. Five locks? Five locks, yes.",LIAM: I want to perception check for traps and for
Survival,"the left down a long hallway. To the left of where you currently are, the hallway continues into darkness and turns around the corner into shadow. Okay, so there was a cell that we were in, and there was a larger room where we were surrounded by Modeth and a lot of people. But there were a lot of hallways Do we smell anything? You smell the residue of burnt wood and tinder. Nothing beyond that. Do I see any tracks that look like they could have been from an elf, an old guy with some battle scars.",MATT: Make a survival check.
Deception,"The very elegantly carved box I had made that contains the magical blue shard that we discovered many, many years ago, and I open it just for a moment and close it and say, this is the Shard of Kara. It is a magical item that can grant the user one wish, any wish. But Scanlan, you said we were going to keep that for ourselves. I did. But it's clear that this man knows who we are and why we've come. No. As a last resort we are cleared to offer this to you in exchange for your prisoner, or is he-- are you holding him as a prisoner or--?",MATT: He shushes you. Make a deception check.
Deception,"will not be involved. You have an hour."" That's all we need. ""What is your password?"" Once he is free, then you get-- in our custody, then you get the note. We'll leave it outside the door. (chuckles) He puts his hand like this and other individuals of the Clasp back out and leave into the hallway behind you and he leads you to follow him and-- I say, careful. Do not open that box without the password or else it will melt your eyeballs from inside your head. (laughter)",MATT: Make a deception check.
Stealth,"And what did Ashley get? Nine. Of course. Okay. I would expect nothing less. I like to think that she looks both ways before attacking just to see-- All right, so. You rage. I rage. Who's doing what now? Vax is our point man. We're both at the door and I called out, so I guess we'll wait a moment to see if he'll-- A moment passes. You want to check? I can open the door.

I can open the door. Well, I already went stealth earlier too, I got a 25 on the stealth check. I can go again if you want. Do you want to try and stealth in the room? If we wait like 30 seconds and nothing happens. Nothing happens, yeah. Okay, make another",stealth check.
Intimidation,"All right. We have now officially, as of this moment, entered combat. You technically would be next in the initiative round at this point, but you're holding your action until-- what are you holding your action until? I was only going to do that if you told me that I could move around him, now that I know that I can't-- All right, you did that, okay. Okay, never mind. Gotcha. All right, cool. So that will be, in theory, the first opening to the battle. Now we start the initiative order. All right. So now we're starting off. Vex, you're up first. I call out: Daxio, don't be a moron. Step outside and lower your weapon, you're surrounded.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Intimidation,"Okay. Good to know. All right, that brings us to Grog. I bellow out: you're in for the fight of your life if you don't drop your polearm. The next thing that hits the ground if you don't will be your skull. Are you using your action to intimidate? Yes. Okay. Go ahead and roll an intimidate check. Don't you have some sort of intimidate thing? He's not in a frenzied rage, though. No, but I'll take Craven Edge out and leave him unsheathed, which gives me an advantage",on intimidation checks.
Intimidation,"He has to make a wisdom saving throw. Yeah. Oh, is that what he was doing against my spell save? Is that what it is? Damn. Wait, no. That is a 17. Sorry, I misdid the math. So it does go through him. So as you finish the Hold Person, he (groans) locks up into place, tense, his eyes darting around with an angry fury. Anything else you want to do? I will, with my bonus, can I talk to him? Yeah. I will say: hey man! Just give up already. Come on! Come on! That's my intimidation.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Intimidation,"Okay. Can I intimidate him to give me his weapon? He can't move. He can't move? Can I go up and try to take his weapon? If you want to. One, two, three, four, five. So you step up into the hallway. And you walk up to him and he's looking at you, sweat dripping down his face, hair matted across the side of his chin. Do it, Pike! Do it. What are you doing? Please give me your weapon. (laughter)",MATT: Roll an intimidation check.
Acrobatics,"lax for a second and looks up at you and can't do anything, because that was his turn, but is no longer seemingly affected by the ability. And just looks up at you with eyes flicking around with thoughts and trying to formulate a plan here. Yeah, like what you see, don't you? Vax, what did you want to do? All right. So I'm hasted, because I did the boots, so I'm going to use Haste to climb through my friends, over Pike, under Grog's legs, and I'm going to-- I'm going to flip daggers over and I'm going to bean this guy in the face a couple of times. Should be a Sneak Attack the first time, because of Grog being there.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check.
Intimidation,"at this point. Can I do a Druidcraft, Matt? A Druidcraft where I druidcraft a vine around his ankles? Sure. Oh, okay, cool. Out of the Grasping Vine, a little vine goes around the legs. It's more of a grapevine. A really pretty to grow plant life on. A grapevine? Grapevines are pretty hard. A white or red grapevine? A red one. Okay, Scanlan, you're up. Me? Jesus. Hey! Hey, dude! Come on! Can you give up, please? Can you please give up? I'm just going to intimidate him again.",MATT: Okay. Roll an intimidation check.
Athletics,"And I'm gonna jump back ten feet again. And pull him out of the room. Anyone? And Percy, you're holding? I'm holding. All righty, Grog. I'm gonna take manacles out of the Bag of Holding. Since he's holding-- his arms are pinned to his chest. And I'm gonna clasp it on both of his wrists. And then I'm gonna pick that motherfucker up on my shoulder and walk out of the room. I'd like to try. And I can help. You can, by just controlling it with your mind. So I will say, go ahead and make an","athletics check, just to--"
Athletics,"Seven. All right. Can I toss Grog my-- some of the infinite rope and tell him to tie him up, tie up his ankles too. As you're holding? Sure. So Vex yells out to you and throws you the source of the infinite rope, you grab and begin to, if you want to, start tying up. All right. Loot tying? I mean, rage tying. Rage tying. (laughter) All right, great. Now it comes to Daxio's turn. He's currently trying to resist the current grappling and your attempt to tie him. That's gonna",be a natural 20 on athletics check.
Investigation,"Much appreciated, Uriel sends his regards, V. All right, okay. You close the door behind you. Do we want to check those other rooms? No. Oh, what about the room he was in? No. What do you mean no? What if he had-- he had stuff to travel with. That's true, he had a lot of money with him. I'll do a quick rummage of it. Very quick.",MATT: All right. Make an investigation roll.
Religion,"night. And then you guys head back into the alleyway. Trinket eagerly (bear grunts). Hey darling. Licks your face. (slurping sounds) Could you do us a favor and carry him? Comes up to you and nudges you to-- I tell them: I'll catch up, guys. I have to say goodbye to my mates. Can we frisk him while we're waiting? I like it. Can I dig in his pockets? Digging in his pockets, you find a strange holy symbol that appears to be a skull that is missing the left side of its face.",ASHLEY: Can I do a religion check on it?
Intimidation,"Are you sure there's no more useful information we can get from this man? So, Riskel, Grog can do it kind of quickish or take a very long time. I've seen him do it. And I start stretching. Digit by digit. You can be sent on your way to whatever asshole you think you're going to, but he can make it very uncomfortable. He could strip you of all your limbs and leave you hanging. Not dead. I once saw him kill a man with his taint. With his own taint.",MATT: Roll an intimidation check.
Deception,"get any information out of him? Well, maybe we should have Pike cleanse his blood so he won't come back after he dies. That's a good idea! Pike, why don't you bless him? Why don't you make him holy? His eyes dart around for a moment with a look of sudden curiosity and worry. Oh, I think that would be fun! ""That's not possible."" Yes, it is. Sarenrae could always use new servants. Right, Pike? Yes, of course! I've seen her regrow a foot. It's amazing.",MATT: Deception check.
Investigation,"The entire party's intelligence goes to one. You get a 1d10 bonus against a roll versus him. It's to knock him down a peg. It's like the fate chips system. It's great. Okay. So who's heading the pub crawl? Am I heading the pub crawl? You don't know this town. Who knows this town the best? None of us know this town. I mean, it's technically our town.

No. Not yet.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Persuasion,"here to fight me, I'm afraid you're going to be terribly disappointed, because I will just let you kill me, if that's what it takes. I didn't know you existed, and my heart is breaking a hundred times now for not knowing it. Every year that you've been alive is a year I could have been a better person and known someone who could have made me a better person, and I'm only sorry that I didn't know it. If there's anything I can do for you from now on-- if you are truly my blood, I will, because among my many faults, ego is certainly one of them, and knowing you're part of me makes me love you even more.

Nature,"inlay that actually almost looks like a very deepset filigree that binds it within the socket itself, like it's very deliberately placed. The craftsmanship of the very, very fine gold filigree, and yet the uncut nature of the emerald, seems strange and as you inspect the emerald itself, it seems almost like while the gem itself is stationary, there is the ever-so-faint image of movement within the gem. Almost like a freshly disturbed pond, like a slight ripple of the surface of water, there is just ever-so-slowly shifting within the gem. I think I've found something evil. Maybe you should not be touching it.","MARISHA: Yeah, can I do a nature check to see if I"
Arcana,"look into a hallway. I'm going to place it back on the column, facing the wall. Okay. Pike, do you want to look at it further? Yeah, can I give it a look? I want to look at the tea set too. I know, I want to go look at the tea set. Let's look at the evil skull first. Can I do a check? Okay, so what are you trying to check about the skull? I don't know, like if it's-- I don't know. I don't know what to check. If it's evil?",LAURA: Is that like an arcana check or--?
Perception,"this, it did fly away. It's not a flying tapestry. Yeah. I just thought I'd try. Maybe just put it over top of that skull and keep it hidden for now. Okay, I take the tapestry and I put it over the skull. Okay. As you throw the tapestry on top of the skull-- Oh boy. Nothing happens. Such an asshole! It's just fun to mess with you guys. All right, so you guys progress down the stairway?","LIAM: Perception check, perception check,"

Survival,"through. Leading the way, stepping from stone to stone to stone, you guys following his pattern, you manage to make your way, all of you, including Trinket who has to (bear grunts). He remembers. Guide you through. You make your way all the way across the room to the teleportation circle, and this is the end of this portion of the hallway. What do you wish to do? Do we step onto it? How does it work? I don't remember. I think we just run ahead. Wait, does it look like there's been anybody in here since we left?",MATT: Go ahead and make a survival check.
Perception,"I think we just run ahead. Wait, does it look like there's been anybody in here since we left? Go ahead and make a survival check. Survival? Jeepers. What in the (popping sound)?! That's my third one of the night. Can I do that one too? I can survival stuff pretty well. Can I assist Grog in finding if our footsteps were the last ones out? True, I was giving this more as a means of giving the trained tracker a better look into",this. I'll give you a simple perception check as
Perception,"range somewhere in the world where there was just ice and snow-capped mountains as far as you could see into this valley of high crags.

Nature,"All right. The combined vision of you three, glancing about, you see there are scattered bits of gold and silver occasionally visible around the floor, but they're all independent and probably thrown about during the scuffle or the collapse. You guys notice there are bits of dragon bone trapped beneath the rocks. Exposed elements of these bones appear to be scraped and already sundered by somebody harvesting the remains, the long-decayed remains, of Brimscythe. You also notice there are two tunnels to the north and south side of this chamber across from where you guys entered. They're smooth, about ten feet in diameter, and both carve into the heart of the rock.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?
Perception,"Can I do a nature check? Umber hulks? Yeah, don't those fuckers do that type of shit? 20 total. 20? Okay. The way these tunnels are created, and you've seen umber hulks and things of that nature carved through, there is a rough aspect to that digging and burrowing process where the earth itself has an uneven, you know, a general purposed direction, but is in itself a very haphazard just grab and tear what's in your way type form of burrowing. These are round and smooth. No scratch marks, claw marks? Almost seems mechanical type of-- magical?",TALIESIN: I'll assist in that perception check.

You also notice there is, to the immediate left and northwestern side of this cavern, a small alcove that just disappears into the wall out of sight. That wasn't there before? Or was that one there before? No, that was there before, yeah. Does it seem like this could have been made by a dragon? These scratch marks? You and dragons-- Favored enemy.

Investigation,"Okay, you spark up a torch. You inspect the inside of this alcove and immediately you see the reflection of the light across the surface of something. Something humanoid standing there in wait. Whoa! And I back up and draw. You draw your weapon and aim it. What you can see, as you take a moment, is an older man, wrinkled in face, eyes open, mouth agape in fear, his arms out before him, back to the wall on the inside. Frozen solid. I found something! I'm inspecting him as best I can, frozen solid. Did you do that? No! No, I found this.",MATT: Investigation check.

If you're going, I'm going with you to protect you because god knows Trinket won't. I'm keeping an eye on the south. I can Move Earth and we can move around earth.

Oh, I said I hid at the end of the episode. I said I hid. Right, roll stealth. Do I have a line of sight with him, or is the edge of that outcropping blocking it? He would have half cover if you were to try and like, throw your weapon at him. It'd be a plus five to his armor class. Pike and I are hiding, too.","MATT: Okay, stealth check for both of you."
Nature,"shakes itself for a second. It has no eyes, so it's not looking in any different direction, it just seems to be flailing in its current location. Can I go into a rage? Yes you may. I would like to rage. All right. (laughs) Are you rolling your special dice? As you bite your lower lip, you feel and taste the blood begin to enter your mouth, and at that point the heat in the back of your shoulders and neck begins to swell up. Grog's into a rage. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.","MARISHA: Can I do, like, a nature check on this"
Nature,"I'll assist. Grog, Grog! Open the bag! (singing) Bigby's Hand will grab the gold. (laughter) Yes! Oh my gosh, get so much gold! Giant scoops into the Bag of Holding.

And once again reminding you, the skull itself, it's humanoid but it's elongated, it's not a human skull. Its jaw itself is-- you would say almost elvish, but the features are too sunken, the teeth are too long, and the skull itself is a little more oblong to the back.

Intimidation,"I've never been more happy in my life. Oh man, I'm coming back as a barbarian if I die. All right, Scanlan, you're up. Oh, there's more people? There's one guy over here by Keyleth who currently hasn't even noticed what's going on because he got hit with lightning twice and is being attacked by a giant tiger. All right. I guess I'll try to intimidate him to stop, and I'll say, I'll turn to him and say, you there! Idiot! (stutters) You're not going to win! You should not fight anymore! Because you're going to die. And that's it, that's all I got.","MATT: Okay, roll intimidation check."
Perception,"no sign of Gilmore or anybody else here, and as the rain's starting to come down a little heavier, you all get that sense of horror washing over you. Vex, you notice, looking underneath where the shattered remains of the foot of his bed are, there is a smooth piece of stone with a handle. And a barrel of lube. I rush over to it. Okay. Can I detect traps now? I mean, you could technically detect traps whenever you wanted to try. Oh. You have to have sight for it. If you want","to, go ahead and make a perception check."
Medicine,"Come over here! Pike, what are you doing? Okay, I'm going to Cure Wounds. It's going to be all right. Pike is here, it's going to be all right, it's going to be all right. Gil? Is there any consciousness? I mean, I can try and assist you, Pike, with Cure Wounds. That's all I have right now. Okay. Yeah, is he conscious? No, unconscious. Unconscious, and looking-- Fading fast? Can you, like, Greater Restoration? I mean, what's the best cure you can do, Pike? Okay okay okay.",MATT: You guys can both make medicine checks to

I mean, what's the best cure you can do, Pike? Okay okay okay. You guys can both make medicine checks to try and put him in a position where he would be more susceptible to healing. 22? I can use a sixth level, and Heal. Use the spell Heal? Yeah.","MARISHA: And I did a 16 on my Medicine check, with"
Stealth,"well is. Is that closer to one of the entrances to the Clasp? The one you're going towards? In the direction. It's a little bit past where you're going so you'd have to double back to the entrance, but it is totally a way to do it. Look, see? Then we're all going to the same place. See? Look at this. I'm going to stay separate from the group so I can stealth a little bit better. Twins out in front. I'm stealthing. Pass Without a Trace on all of us, then.",MATT: Stealth checks from all those that are
Investigation,"and come back-- You can come with us. You can come with us. I mean, it's up to you. I know you need to talk to the Clasp, so if you need to talk to them and let them know we're on our way-- Enough treasure to go around. I could definitely let them know. It's up to you. I'm relieved that it's there and not destroyed, so. Okay. So, you guys, now knowing where the entrance is, you make your way back out. You close the cellar and make your way towards where this dwarf's general description of the well is. I want",you to make an investigation check.
Perception,"wandering the area unable to find really which destination this is, partially because a lot of the sections here are partially destroyed or at least are unfamiliar to you. You've not spent a lot of time in this northern area of Emon. Scanlan, you dart off for a second, seeing a similar crossroads between alleys, and you find a well that very much appears to be, and you know it's yours because there's a number of copper and gold coins that are scattered around the base of the well. This is it. Traps? I look around. Can I perceive anything or any people around, anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Survival,"(laughs) There are none around you, and you gather from the sheer immensity that is the Cinder King that if he were to come down here and retrieve this gold himself, most of the adjacent buildings and the well would be ruined. So people put a bunch of gold there then someone else came and took it? Well, allegedly a bunch of gold. Maybe that's all they found. It's your fucking people from the Clasp, isn't it? No! Can I use tracking to see if it looks like anybody's been here?",MATT: Sure. Make a wisdom survival check.
Perception,"Okay, and what do you two do? I'm going back to my trap door. Okay. So Garthok, you step away from the group and head back to the Clasp. Thank you for-- It's been a great day killing with you. I hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the catacombs. I will let the Clasp know that you're coming. Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt to open the door. They stealthed, so I don't know where they went, do I?",MATT: Roll a perception check.
Survival,"hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the catacombs. I will let the Clasp know that you're coming. Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt to open the door. They stealthed, so I don't know where they went, do I? Roll a perception check. I got a natural 20 on my stealth. Got a nine on perception. You have no clue. Can I look at the tracks? I can't read tracks.","MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom survival check,"
Stealth,"Can I look at the tracks? I can't read tracks. Go ahead and make a wisdom survival check, just for the hell of it. Three. Three? Okay. You begin following a set of tracks that you think is pretty close to theirs. Pike, you're with everyone else bringing the rest of them back to the keep. You're with the other half of the group. You're with me, Pike. We're babysitting. You guys are babysitting the family and Gilmore, getting him back to the keep.","ASHLEY: Oh. Wait, why did I stealth check?"
Insight,"""fairly underground."" Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off dragon? ""Not yet, but I believe Jarett's keeping a close eye."" Jarett-- That guy. Man-crush? No. (laughter) I wonder, in all prudence, should we go around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a quick--",LAURA: Insight check?
Insight,"Lauryn Hill is shaking her head. Do we have anything that can sense people's alignment? Pike might. Yeah, I can. Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment? Mass sense alignment? Is that a thing? No, I'm saying I could do some insight checks on people. Oh, I'm talking about your magic. No, I'm not Pike. All right. Pike's with us, though, right? She could",do an insight check.
Insight,"Maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example. This is terrible, what is happening? This isn't the real game, the game hasn't actually started yet. So. Glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of Greyskull Keep, I will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors of the crew. Is this insight? This would be insight, yes. I'm on it. I'm on it with Vex. Okay, so Vex and Keyleth, both you guys roll","insight checks, please."
History,"it's rubble, I mean it's gone. The city is gone. There's, like, a huge chasm, a huge empty spot in the middle of the forest where Syngorn once lied. Lie. Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to nothing? Or transported somewhere? Like that. Like transported, like the city was lifted out of its place and was teleported elsewhere. Could it have been-- I don't know how your scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a magical block? Not real, an illusion of some sort? I would like Vax and Vex to both roll a",history check.
Persuasion,"We have a plan. We probably can only take a few. It should be women and children. We're going to take those of you who need the most attention first, and we're going to bring you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all. It has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor, and you can earn a wage and find a living there, for the time being, and if at some point in time you want to come back to Emon when all of this is done, of course you're more than welcome to. There is opportunity. And no dragons!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Insight,"We'll count to six, and then we'll put the rope down, and when we hit six, we pull the rope, and it'll hold everybody-- Wait, there's a rope? As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll hold the people back. Yes, hold the people back. So Percy, you're first, everybody follow through. So any families here? Families? Some of the kids raise their hands, some adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand next to them. ""Yes."" Are you really respons-- I can tell when you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Intimidation,"reach your hand out and touch the outside of the tree's bark, with a rough tearing sound, the tree bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is immediately visible. On the opposite side, you can see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape that is the central market of Whitestone. We put blankets on everybody, right? From what you had. Go! Go! Now, run, go! Go, Percy, go! Who's pushing? I'm already through. Percy's through. All right, are you guys just letting them go at their own rate? (shouting) Move your fucking asses!",MATT: Roll an intimidation check.
Stealth,"Once a day? After another long rest you'd be able to use it again. All right. Good to know. All right. Into the city. In your pants. Like you do. Half-elven storage space. You guys find your way back into Emon, utilizing your secret tunnel entrance, coming up through the false outhouse once again. You leave the chain behind, locking it up, and make your way into the city. Cast Pass Without a Trace on us. All right. You guys, I'd like you all to",make a stealth check.
Acrobatics,"the die. Aw, sorry buddy. It happens to the best of us. All righty. So. Currently with this guy up on top of the rooftop, Percy, you are first. Quick question, is he in flight, or is he just sitting on the rooftop? Just sitting on the roof, perched on the edge. You can't even actually see him, everyone else who's near the front can see, the few that made the check. You've got a little bit of movement up there, but you're just out of view with the building-- you're right in an alleyway. There's no easy way up onto the roof, is there?",MATT: Aside from a well-placed acrobatics check.
Perception,"Percy shot at them. Okay. There's one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off. Instead of holding the same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons, he's carrying a gnarled staff. Oh, shit. Steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing, this large metallic dangerous entity, looks forward and begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish). Do I see this? You do. I'm going to release my-- Though you are being slammed on the ground.","I'd say make a perception check, actually, to see"
Acrobatics,"I'll do it at a level four. (laughing) Okay. And I will sing to myself  sadly, pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down. (laughter) All right! So that is 4d4 plus five healing to yourself. Okay, 4d4 plus five-- That's 14 plus five.19. 19. So you heal yourself 19 hit points. That ends your turn. Up next, Vax. I'm going to scramble up to the top of the building that I'm right next to.",MATT: Acrobatics check.
Perception,"I have a Flame Tongue Dagger. Okay, so you pull the Flame Tongue Dagger. It puts out a very, very low candlelight, opens up the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very, very shallow, a couple inches, shallow water. Looking around you, you are in a subterranean sewer system. The smell hits you as you hit the bottom of it. This is the entire underbelly of Emon, and there is the slight sound of trickling water that's rushing through this tunnel you're currently standing in. The ladder drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop. Looking to your right, it descends a little further down on that","side, and you can hear-- make a perception check."
Perception,"Let's go towards-- Towards the light. I'll do whatever they say. Are we going towards the light or towards the rushing water? Light. All who vote ""light,"" say ""aye."" Aye. All who vote ""water,"" say ""aye."" Aye. To the light. So you guys head-- left, or-- Is there any-- I'm sorry, one last question. Is there any Thieves' Cant on the walls at all?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"to flee this city. ""Safer."" But before we make that decision-- yes, it is-- we know that you're the next best thing to a government in Emon. ""Hmm."" And we want to know what's left behind. ""Well, we're seeing to our own. We're going to see how many of our allies still lie within the ""city. Going to reach out to our friends across Tal'Dorei and see how much of a network we still ""stand to keep. Then we call in a few debts, reach out to some friends and, ah, we see if we can find ""some way to supplant this red thing.""",LIAM: Can I insight check?
Perception,"devastating attack, there's no other system-- If the Clasp were to vanish, something else would take its place. They're inevitable. But I don't want to introduce them to Vasselheim, no. At the cost of people starving or not starving. We're already here, Keyleth. I'm down for joining them and letting them join our cause, and using their infrastructure, but beyond that-- Can I use perception to make sure that we're really private right now?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"If the parasite hasn't a host to feed on, the parasite dies. No, thank you. Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need to sell myself for the greater good. ""Very well. Unfortunate as it is. Step forward."" Is this a whisper? No, this is him asking you to step forward. He steps really close to you, and he takes you by the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him. Do you resist? I'm going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends.",MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.
Stealth,"about. I wanted people on the inside keeping us informed, and we just lost a very powerful spy network. I think the only people on the inside right now have scales. Everybody needs something. Can we go back to the keep? We are not going to bother. We're going to go and we're going to find a way of killing these things, and we're going to hope for the best in this city. That's what we're going to do. As you guys are heading back, I need stealth checks from everybody.",LAURA: Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace.
Stealth,"29. We have a plus ten? 33. All right. You guys push southward through the city, finding your way. At this point, the sun has set. Night has come in, and occasionally you hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city. At one point, you hear a similar (raspy cry) sound, and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops, heading in your direction, Keyleth. What do you guys do? The minute we see that, I'm going to push her against the wall, and I'm going to Minor Illusion a shadow right over her.",MATT: Okay. Make a new stealth check with
Arcana,"Hey, what's in that bag? Yeah, what'd you catch? She walks up to the table where Mertin's standing, he reaches out to greet her, with arms extended. She throws it into his arms, he catches it, pulls it open. You see within there is a head of what looks like a humanoid head, but the skin is greyish and featureless. The eyes are whitish and milky. What hair is there, in wisps, is white in color. Who here is trained in arcana? I think I am. I am. You know what this is. I already know.",MATT: Roll an arcana check.
Persuasion,"can just have? Don't they have like a supply room? It would be welcome. ""We have things we can provide, as you are members."" Oh good, yes. ""Mind you, not extremely active members as of late, but..."" But we will be. Think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather wings and scales. We're about to get really fucking active. We're going to be so fucking rich. Think of the armor I could forge you from red dragon parts.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Deception,"Those are the Knickknacks of Kaa. I know, and they're quite valuable. But he said six thousand, six hundred and (mumbles) and we know this will cover that. I can't. Please sir, please don't take advantage of us by taking these things from us. They're too valuable, please, I beg of you. What have you pulled out? The Knickknacks of Kaa. The Knickknacks of Kaa?! No, not the Knickknacks of Kaa! (worried sigh) Now I'm doubting-- No, you know what, maybe I shouldn't trade these. Put them away, put them away.",MATT: Make a deception check. Make a deception
Sleight of Hand,"Oh wait, I don't get to roll? Huh? I don't get to roll anything? No, it just gives her advantage. 27. (sighs) Oh, that's good. That was a really good roll. (laughs) That was good. He goes, ""No, no, no, no. Put them on the table, please. I would like to have a look. Just ""in casies."" I'll put one of them down so you can look. As she places it down, can I do a little Gust cantrip and do a little poof of air?",MATT: Sure. Make a sleight of hand check.
Sleight of Hand,"Really quickly, while the Thaumaturgy is happening, I'm going to cast Minor Illusion, just go for it. What is happening right now?! We're stacking the deck, man. We're stacking it. Any one of these could fail. If they all succeed, it's going to be dope. I'm going to make a-- the image of a beautiful woman briefly appear in the reflection of the object and then vanish. Just a gleam. That's hot. That's hot. Thank you.",MATT: You need to make a sleight of hand check.

Intimidation,"me, darling. ""Well then, step away. You don't need my business, obviously. Is this how your 'Shiny ""Manager' deals with your shinies? Or would you wish to deal with this face to face?"" Tell you what. Take two thousand off your asking price and we have a deal. ""That is ridiculous! No."" How's your family? ""What does that mean?"" Just curious how everybody's doing? Everybody healthy, happy? Yeah, are they well? In one piece? Have you seen your wife?",MATT: Make an intimidation check. (laughing) With
Perception,"My guess is he couldn't get to the front of the tent by the time we got to him. But that's up to you. We're just guests here. No, it's all right. I know they're expensive. And we've already taken enough advantage. Yeah, if they're what they say they are. No! That's what I'd do. Cross your fingers. Can I sniff and make sure it's actually a real potion that he gave us? Did he give us fucking fake potions? You can go back and take a moment and sniff,",yeah. Go ahead and make a perception check.

Persuasion,"You're welcome. ""Hiiii!"" H-hi. I give the money to Percy to give to him. And I hand it out. (laughter) ""Would you like some coffee?"" Victor! Thank you, you're so kind. And if you would be so lovely as to not mention us to my friend if she should happen back. ""50 gold."" Oh, shit! Tell you what, Victor. I don't think you want to tell her anything.",MATT: Make a persuasion roll.
Perception,"half-orc gentleman. Damn it, I was hoping it was Kima! That would have been hilarious. He walks in, wiping his hands from dirt in the mines, stops, looks over at your table. Slowly backs out of the tavern and steps back out into the thoroughfare. Hey, look at that guy who went out the door! He looked like that guy you fought in that ring. Really? That guy, yeah. Go get (stammering) do it again. Hold on a second. And I run out the door. I run after him, out the door.",MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Nature,"But it doesn't seem antagonistic in any way. No. Just-- they're protecting their temple. We'll make it that, though. You guys continue inward, towards the central chamber, the high stone ceiling before you. You can see there are holes carved throughout the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of light to come shooting through from the sky. What catches your interest in here is that the sky is cloudy. There is no specific source of direct sunlight, yet there are beams of light within the temple itself that form a pattern across the stone marble floor of the central chamber.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?
Religion,"""And I feared it was the work of our lord's nemesis."" Straight-up nemesis? Yes, can you elaborate? He puts his hand up. Sorry.

Athletics,"really catch yourself, and just land flat on your back in the sand. (wheezing sounds) We're all hanging back. Puts his arm down. Just watching. ""Strongjaw. Where do you find your strength?"" In my anger. ""You walk between worlds. Weakness in mind or weakness in conviction. What do you stand for? ""Where do you find your strength?""

He looks over to the rest of you on the side of the pit. ""Choose."" (sighs) I choose my buddy Pike. She's not here. I don't care, I just say it anyway. I choose Vax and I choose Scanlan.

I feel like we're missing something, wait, you're trying to get us passage to the back-- You're trying to get us passage to the Knuckles place, is that, get them passage? Or are you trying to get us to the lake? I'm so confused. This is out of character, I literally don't have an idea what's going on.",TRAVIS: I want to insight check Kima.
History,"Well, you don't have any reason to think that. Could be hanging from a tree branch. I'm sure. You know what, Grog, that's an excellent point. Yeah. Just hiding in plain sight. Hanging on a tree branch under the lake. That's where I'd hide it. Z, Kash, you all have been by the Loch before, would you know what-- It was pretty unremarkable last time we were there if it's the one I'm thinking of. Actually, I may have remembered something about the Loch? What do I, would I have remembered anything at all?",MATT: Make a history check.
Investigation,"All right. I'm in. Is there a library nearby? (laughs) Oh, it's been two weeks and I missed you guys. Do we have a library at the Take? Hm? There are a collection of books at the Take, but most of them are in reference to cataloging various creatures, details about their lifestyles, their inherent weaknesses, what elements of their bodies can be harvested and what clients are usually looking for. It's more specific to the business of the Slayer's Take than anything that would involve local history. I mean, I'll say if two of you would like to make an","investigation check between the two, your choice,"
Persuasion,"for them, but they usually like things in mint condition when they buy their antiques. This has a damaged spine, I see it, and yellowing of the pages. And it seems like somebody's bookmarked this one. It wasn't kept in its neoprene sleeve. He slams the book shut as you're perusing through the pages. ""30 gold, or I will ask you to ""leave."" Oh. This is the worst haggling ever. Get out your buyer's guide. What's your name? (groaning) Just kill him!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Stealth,"half-measure. About the same as the Firebrand-ish? It's technically non-magical. Okay. 14. 14. You manage to just barely, as you see this thing coming towards you, and duck beneath it. I thought you were going to tell me a dirty joke, or something! When you say ""come here,"" usually that's what that means! No, I wanted to try out the hammer. Oh. Well then, no! Try it on Vax. I'm already 20 paces away. Vax? I go stealth.",MATT: Roll stealth. Roll a perception check.

Insight,"Try as you might to look around, Vax is nowhere to be seen. I literally just pivoted around my sister and pressed against her. Doing exactly what she does? I'm going to use Minor Illusion to make a really shitty Vax. A really cruddy-looking Vax. Not in Vasselheim! Oh, shit. Too late. Too late. So as you're looking around, you see this strange quiver of shadow that seems to formulate in the air, and this awkward, still, unmoving, awkward mannequin-type visual recreation of Vax muddles itself there. I need you to roll an",insight check.
Perception,"full to the top, if a little icy at the surface, it seems relatively undisturbed. You make your way, all drifting down, back beneath the canopy of the Vesper Timberland, and at the edges of the lake. Are there any islands in the loch? Are there any islands or any sort of rocks or outcroppings, or anything within the loch itself? No, actually. It's a pretty solid surface, and as you guys have drifted down in your form, looking at it, you can see that there is a layer of ice. You're not quite sure how thick, but the surface is very crystalline. Any remnants of ruins around the loch?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Investigation,"looked like caves? That's what I was keeping my eye out for as we went. Make a perception check for you, as well. 25. 25. You see there are bits of stone scattered about 30 feet out from the lake's edge. Going to inspect them, and looking about them, there are pieces of fallen walls and what appear to be elements of the tomb, possibly before it fell within, but you do not see any sort of opening or entrance. It's just a part of some structure, some foundation that was left behind. Are there any runes or any markings of any kind?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"and receded into the earth itself was probably about a half-mile to a mile back. Nothing that is in the immediate vicinity of this lake. Okay. Is this technically-- are we in the woods? Is this my favored terrain again? Yes. You guys have come down into the forest. You're all still in mist form, so you're unable to directly interact with anything in the area. 11. 11? Doesn't seem to have any specific elements or markings. Can I try, as well, because I can read any writing that we find? May I make a check, as well?",MATT: Make an investigation check. Sure.
Perception,"Okay. Testing it with your foot on the edge, it doesn't seem to be any give. Looking up close, you can see it's probably a good inch and a half of ice. Can I go hit the place where Grog hit his head and see if I can crack a hole in the ice? Yeah. It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to break apart and make a head-sized hole. And how thick is it, based on what she just did? It's about an inch. Oh, just an inch. Ooh. This is going to suck! And I put my head underwater to see if I can look around.",MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.
Investigation,"Breathing. Oh, killer. Our good old Zahra is already down there looking. Let's try to set up camp in the trees, so we're not on the ground. Yeah, like in Whitestone. As they're setting up camp, Kash doesn't leave the side of the lake. He's just watching for where Z went in. He's just staring the whole time. All right, so as you guys are setting up camp in a similar way that you did in Whitestone, up within the actual tree canopy itself, I need",you to make an investigation check.
Nature,"happened. What do you mean, there was no plant life? Well, I went down. There were two entrances, and obviously they had crumbled and were no longer accessible, and it seemed like there was one more, but around it-- there was pretty substantial plant life all around, coming out from the ground, but in about a ten-foot area, there was nothing there. And I tried to get down in with my snout, but all I did was kick up more silt, and I couldn't really see anything. Strange. This was at the bottom of the ocean floor? Of the loch, yes. The loch.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if that

Investigation,"I can do my beast thing. I'll be fine. I jump in and go shark form. I go to the edge of the loch and watch. So do I. Okay, so the two of you are waiting at the edge of the loch? Keyleth jumps off the edge, and in midair, forms into this giant shark form that slams into the surface of the cold water through the opening that Grog had already opened. She's really attractive now, isn't she? That shark. I'm with Kash, man. What? Huh? (laughter)",MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"slams into the surface of the cold water through the opening that Grog had already opened. She's really attractive now, isn't she? That shark. I'm with Kash, man. What? Huh? (laughter) All right. Make an investigation check. I can't do nature, or anything like that? Are you inspecting the ruin? What do you want to do? Can I see if the hole is natural-made, or man-made?",MATT: Investigation check.
Investigation,"it doesn't appear to be man-made, by any means. It just looks to have formed by some perpetual disturbance of the muddy earth in that vicinity. Sounds like a creature. Anything else you want to investigate while you're down there? Does there appear to be any type of motion, or does it look like it's going downward, or is it just flat? It has some variation to it, and there's a portion that appears to have been dug up, or at least, there is a slight indentation. Let me do a quick lap around the ruins and see if I see anything that jumps out at me.",MATT: Okay. Make another investigation check about
Perception,"There's a difference between climbing a tree and getting up into a tree and then getting into a comfortable place where you can rest and not destroy the tree. It's a combination of minor druidic talents to create an element of the tree's growth that would be able to support a weight the size of a bear. Yeah, I grow a basket. Yeah. You've done it before. A bear basket. Trinket's very thankful. All right, the two of you keep watch for the first watch. We'll say for about a four-hour period. Okay. As the end of your watch progresses,",I need you both to make a perception check.
Perception,"(laughter) The clinking of armor as Kima rolls over on one of the branches and is face-palming at the conversation. You are really fucking cool. You know that, don't you? At this point, you hear a distant screech that echoes across the night sky. All of you wake up. While not extremely loud, it is very noticeable and cuts through the silence, as there is a very still wind tonight. Even if my sister's waking up, I kick her hard in the ass. Ah! Fuck you!","MATT: You two, make a perception check."
Perception,"find an opening that you guys didn't see yesterday. I'm going to take a walk around the whole thing and see if I can see anything on the edges. How big-- you said the lake was like 350 feet-- It's about 350 feet circumference around. It's not a very, very large-- I can destroy water, but I don't know. I can control water. Could you, like, make a, you know, parting of the Red Sea sort of thing? I might be able to, actually, yeah. Try that.",LIAM: Did a 22 perception check around the edge of

Are you keeping your light spells up? No. Both of you snuff the light spells, so you have zero visibility right now. I am really well-hidden. I've got darkvision. I do, too. So do I.",MATT: Stealth checks from everybody?
Perception,"22. 28. 17. 17. With the plus ten? 14. 14. With the plus ten? No, then it's 24. 24. Okay. Is there any light here? Dim light? There is no light. We just doused it. Grog and I can see. Darkvision. These two figures just walk beyond. What little bit you can see, and both of you guys roll","perception checks, those with darkvision right"
Perception,"I've noticed that you all have some sort of earpiece. Do you have any extra? No, but I'm going to go with you, so I'll be able to report. Oh, great. Okay, two of you stay behind. Kash, are you sure you don't want to go with Vax? No, I'm good. Thank you. All right. All right, so. Grog and Vax, you guys traverse to the right, with what little light he's giving off the dagger. It continues for about 15 feet before it curves sharply to the right. Roll a","perception check, Grog."
Nature,"Grog, there's a spiral staircase and some snot. So we're going to keep going. Wait, wait. You're going down into the snotty-- Talking to Grog! Let's all go down into the spiral staircase. I heard it, as well. We don't want to split up. Wait there for a minute. Is there any moss-snot near Percy and I, in the middle of the hall? Looking about your general vicinity, very quickly. At your foot, yeah, there's some. Can I do a check-- A snot check?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"how it-- We're all in the same tunnel now? You guys are all making your way down the left tunnel, down the spiral staircase that Zahra found. So. You progress downward. You're looking for--? Traps. I'm looking for traps. Just keeping an eye out? Yeah, I'm using the light from her thumb or whatever. My staff. I want to look for any imperfections in the stairs that look like they could collapse at any time or they could be unsafe.",MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks with
Perception,"Hey, Keyleth? Have you ever seen feathers like this? Do they appear to be raven feathers? They are raven feathers, yes. Why were they covered in goo? Maybe this was some sort of offering to the Raven Queen? We might be getting close. Fuck. The Raven Queen. Right, that makes sense. Well done. Thank you. You guys: ravens. Ravens, yeah. Onward. Pressing down the spiral staircase. It comes to another floor beneath the one you just hailed","from. Go ahead and make another perception check,"
Investigation,"22? All right, you (zoomf) just out of the way as these two pendulum blades (whoosh) right past you, missing you by about a half an inch. And then (whoosh) disappear and then swing back a second time, resetting on opposite sides of the hallway. We all saw that, right? You all saw that with a very (whoosh, whoosh). Scythes in the wall? My nose tickles right now. I'm going to attempt to take these out and-- hold on. Can I perceive around and see if I see any switches or anything that would turn them off?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Can I perceive around and see if I see any switches or anything that would turn them off? Make an investigation check. Thieves' tools to disarm, right? Based on the check you previously made, these are a little more intricate and you're having a hard time finding a way to disarm them. This would be more of trying to find a mechanism in which to disarm them, which she is currently doing. This wouldn't be Underdark-y at all, would it? No. Then I rolled a ten.","MATT: Well, this is an investigation check."
Investigation,"hidden, if there is a way to be able to disable the trigger. You have not encountered this before, and it is a little beyond your expertise at the moment. Grog, there's giant scythes in the wall or something and I can't figure out how to take it apart. Do you have a weapon that you could jam in this fucker? Like a throwaway weapon that you don't care about? Yeah. I've got three greatswords that are shit. Do you want to fucking fuck this knife hole with a sword? On Vex's suggestion, I'm going to make an",investigation check. 30.
Perception,"vision, you would have to travel up with him to be able to see around the corner as you move. Vex, could you tell Zahra to come up another 20 feet or so? Coming. Coming now. So I go up and I stand next to him. Walk quietly, dear. As you continue to move forward with him, the light cascading further down the hall, eventually the curvature comes to a halt and you can see before you a T-intersection of the tunnel. Across the way, the tunnel directly across from you comes to a halt. It just ends about 20 feet beyond this intersection. There is a path to the",right and the left. Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"How strong are you? (laughing) I'm terribly not strong at all. No, but I can get in and get out. Can't carry any one person over? Maybe a gnome? I could maybe try to leap from the sides of the hole or something. Where it meets this center area, it's only about a five-foot step over. Oh. To the other parts of the intersection. I could totally parkour that. As long as you're not going directly across. If you're just going catty-corner, it would be a",relatively easy acrobatics check. Barring you
Acrobatics,"If you're just going catty-corner, it would be a relatively easy acrobatics check. Barring you don't roll a one. Hold on, I've got this figured out. Hold on. Hold on, shush.

Can we just look down? Does my darkvision extend at all 60 feet down into the hole to see what's there? All right, as you guys approach, Vax deftly attempts to leap over to the right side of the",T-junction. Make an acrobatics check.

All right, as you guys approach, Vax deftly attempts to leap over to the right side of the T-junction. Make an acrobatics check. That's a 30-something. 30-- Three. Perfect two-toed landing. Just (ta-ding). And you are immediately met with... a wall. It ends to the right. It's almost like across the way and immediately to the right both just end abruptly. And there's nothing here?",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Religion,"You can see there are symbols burned into what looks to be some sort of a bird head that ends in these streaks that are carved into the rock. Intricately, and done with a very careful hand. (groans) There's a bunch of bullshit on this wall and a raven's head, and I don't know what any of it fucking means. I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly over and to read it. Wait, you can read bullshit? I can read bullshit. I have-- Oh, I read bullshit. Eyes of the Runekeeper. Okay. It's not a language. It is a symbol.",But you can make a religion check.
Acrobatics,"I'm going to hop over to where the doors are. I hop over to the doors, too. Okay. Both of you guys make acrobatics checks. Jesus, don't fall. (high-pitched noise) 13. 14. 31. Okay. Yeah, you guys make it across fine. Can I just fly over and land? Kima's getting impatient, and she joins you guys across that way. She's fine on her roll. Yeah, I'll jump over towards the doors as well.",MATT: Okay. Acrobatics check.
Investigation,"Good to join us, Grog. Yeah, no big deal. Good to know you can jump at all. Yes, how'd that work for you? Listen, an example of what not to do. Are your hands okay? Yeah. Should we proceed? What is all this dilly-dally? Are the doors locked? You go ahead and push on the door? Wait! What are you doing over there? Are there traps on the door? I check for traps. Wait up-- okay, go for it.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"16. Okay. Looking over it, there is what looks to be a locking mechanism on it, but it is not currently locked. Well, that was lucky. Is it? (door squeaking sound) I push? You push? (thump) It doesn't budge. You have to put some of your weight behind it to get it to shift at all, and it (creak) opens up slightly into a pitch-black room ahead of you. Oh good, more darkness. I peek in and, using my darkvision, see what I can see for 60 feet.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"pillars reach to the ceiling, and there are steps across the way, what appears to be a raised platform. That's the most detail you can make out of it at this distance-- you'd have to get close. Can't see much. It's a taller ceiling, there seems to be a platform in the middle and some pillars. Like a platform like a tomb? No, I can't see, really. Like an altar? It's a slightly raised platform, that's-- Grog, can you help? Can you do anything, can you see any further than me?

That's what I thought, and I'm going to throw three daggers at his fuckin' eyeball. Go for it. You used your bonus action to hide, so you get two attacks. Two attacks? But I got the hasted boots on. I clicked the heels. Right. But you only have one attack with your main action. Oh, right! Thanks. And do I have advantage-- no one's near him, right?",MATT: You have to roll a stealth check to see if
Athletics,"There we go, right there, that's perfect. And I would like to use the Chain of Returning on Craven Edge and throw it up into the bottom of the Beholder. Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack. 23. That hits! With a five, it fails its saving throw, so you take a plus one strength, he takes a minus one strength. Yay, amazing! 19. 19? Yeah, 19 points of damage. All right, great. The blade sinks into it, as you yank it back, go ahead and make an",athletics check to pull the blade back.
Stealth,"You have to guess. You don't know the specific elements of his ray. I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide. Well, first and foremost, at the beginning of your turn, I need you to make a dexterity save. Yeah, evasion. Yeah, don't worry. That's 30. All right. Don't say you're using evasion yet. It doesn't damage you. Or you could have wasted your evasion for no reason. However, you do avoid being grappled as they try and grab onto you and hold onto you. You can use your bonus action to--? Hide.","MATT: All right, roll a stealth check."
Perception,"25, okay. I'm going to run past Trinket along the back wall, all around the edge, over to where Vex and Kash are. All right, right there. I'm going to keep pushing along-- This is our spot! I'm going to get between them, and I know that slows the movement down, but I want to be in there, and I'm going to use my two actions left to throw daggers at the floating fucking bowling ball with eyes. I duck so he can shoot. You do not have advantage, because it rolled",a natural 20 on its perception check and you are
Athletics,"automatically fail dexterity saving throws. Oh my god, that's bad. All right. The beam hits you and your skin begins to turn a dull gray as you begin to see your flesh beginning to harden around your body. That ends its turn. Grog, you're up. Can I run as far into the alcove that is at his rear, just underneath him, as far as I can? Yeah, right there. Maybe one step closer, so right underneath him. You're still attached to the thing? Yeah. Yeah, so I'd like to pull the blade out. Okay, so this will be your bonus action to",pull it out. Make your athletics check.
Athletics,"To, like, punch the beholder into the ground? Oh, you can attempt to make a slam attack to push it down, if that's what you're wishing to do. That's what I want to do. All right, go ahead and make the attack. Yeah! Yeah, yeah. Big money, no whammies. Okay, okay, that's not bad, that's not bad. 21! That was awesome. Okay. 21, that definitely hits. Let me just-- Kill him, Keyleth! There we go. All right, so actually, that",would be your athletics check.

And on the corpse itself, you can see there is a set of jet-black studded leather armor that has a series of runic engravings and carvings along pretty much every square inch of the leather. And you can see around the the mantle of it, where the leather mantle falls, the edge is trimmed with black feathers. That's hot. That's fuckin' sick. That's some Labyrinth of Jareth shit right there. Artists, go!",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Insight,"Kash walks over and heals Kima. Okay, as Kima gets pulled over the edge, you reach over and help. She's like, ""Thanks, ""appreciate that, I-- that didn't go as planned.

Did you black out? ""No."" Did you pee your underoos?",MATT: (laughs) Make an insight check.
Perception,"It's infinite rope! Yeah, but I would throw the whole thing down. I throw it down to him. Are there any beholder teeth left? Anything? Any sort of-- I mean, there are chunks of, there are a few full teeth that you could try and take. Keyleth actually goes over and starts doing her harvesting thing. Not a whole lot left to harvest.

Arcana,"Six. The energy itself vibrates within the glass shards, which then shatter, seemingly not able to focus the energy of the spell. I take my enchanted moonstone from my staff and place it next to her. Okay, so as you take the moonstone, and-- are you speaking to your patron to aid with this? I am. All right, so as you take the moonstone and hold it aloft, you place it near the focus of Kashaw's ritual. The dull white glow begins to intermingle with the dark, shattered energy of Vesh's grant, and as they impact, it creates this strange grey swirl. I need you to go ahead and",roll an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your
Persuasion,"something next. (whispered) That's good. That's good. 17. Okay. The grey balances, and where the two meet now, there is just grey energy seeping into her body. You, focusing, look up at the altar where the body was, and you see the very faint drifting image of a dark female form looking on. Who wants to make the third and final attempt to aid? I will-- I do. Oh, sure, I will let you do that. I pull my sister in close, and I say, take me instead, you raven bitch.",MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. With

However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out
Perception,"check to see if you can ascertain. 16. 16. It's difficult to make out at this distance, but you can see, along portions of the jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain, and their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections. Do they look like people, like humanoids? It's hard to tell from this distance, they look human-ish, humanoid-ish. I attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them.","MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check."
Stealth,"There are no birds in the sky. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area, especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that you're used to seeing. You glance around for about a minute or two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air. Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up? We should. Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly. Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.","MATT: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check,"
Perception,"Okay. You guys begin making your trek up. How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling the cooled flow? Yeah. That's probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it, because of the formation of this giant volcanic caldera, there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side. As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection. All right. You guys continue in pace with this, eventually, and make",another perception check?
Perception,"about, just tearing through what remains of this countryside, and let's see, you actually, Vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward, keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities, these creatures, you catch out of the corner of your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a tree. I ask everyone to wait. Percy. Yes? Can you look through your scope and see who that is? I'll take a look.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"What could happen? I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all of us. You did. Did we already have it? Did we already have it? From last time? As long as you're maintaining your concentration, how long does it last for? Concentration? I believe it-- It holds for up to an hour. An hour, yeah, so you can still be under that effect. Sweet. So I would like all six of you to roll","stealth checks for me, if you could."
Acrobatics,"of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke that has completely engulfed the above skyscape, behind you, bounding very loudly, is a gentle gnome, swishing brown hair-- I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari just did. Right. It's not working. Hot, hot, hot. And as you're darting across, you're jumping over little open globules of molten lava that is starting to pour out from various crevices in the stone floor, you try to hop around to avoid that, and in doing so, your foot catches the edge of a piece of stone, and you begin to go into a tumble.",Make an acrobatics check.
Stealth,"assume? They're not very delicate, unfortunately. No, no, they're really for protection. Now, the zombies can really take a lot of damage to the front of the chest and the skeletons are quite quick, actually. So, you know. They've been fairly good for a while. All right. Good to know. We head towards the thing. Stealthily. To the thing! Shush! Stealthily. (whispering) To the thing!","MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, if you"

I'm going to do a fire radial thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will heed my word. Quite dramatic, isn't she? As you guys are watching this from a distance, all you hear is (guttural noises). It's really confusing and a little hilarious, to be honest. I think it's going well.",MATT: I need you to make an intimidation check.
Sleight of Hand,"whoosh). And it's more of a smoldering sad elemental at the moment. I give them a fire thumbs-up. There you go. Strong sad elemental. First word. Two syllables. So, they're going back. Do we move on? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift. Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might be escaping. All right. This is her game. Yeah, but it's on fire.",MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

Persuasion,"low and dive into that lava pit in front of me. Ooh! Sounds scary. And I want to-- using the lava around me to rise out of the lava and look really scary and badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning! I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance. Pretty good. Pretty good. Way better than last time. Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like to meet for coffee later I might be available. I'll say, given the use of lava control in this, they are still elementals, go ahead and","make a persuasion check.

Perception,"gone, but you didn't see it happen and it's a little disappointing overall. I kick the dirt. All right. You guys look over as this elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you see further down this passage. It's not that far away from you, but you do see the flickering doorway that's like (sputtering). You can see other entities beginning to step out of it, and you can see one larger form. It looks fiery, humanoid, just (crackling) comes out, lower body made of ash and cinders. I rush that way and look for my other tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"presence of the tear. Oh my gosh. Probably fine. Probably. I don't think this will be bad We did not take a short rest, did we? No, you did not. There has been no time. I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop oh shit, I have a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking about. And I have a feeling he's not going to believe that I'm the real new master. So there's that. So do some cold stuff, like this guy.","MATT: I'd like you all to make a stealth check, by"
Arcana,"Top of the combat round. Yeah, nope. Not leading. All right. Shitty initiative roll. It's going to be fine. He's cut things out of cardboard. This doesn't look fun. There was planning. There was a thought process. Oh shit, towers. There was an instructables involved in this. This is just really-- we're doomed. No, no, he was down in the play zone before!",MATT: Tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as

You can see now streaks of its own blood are pouring down, boiling on contact with air, the significant difference in temperature from the exterior and its actual interior body causing it to change from a liquid to a gas. That's our rogue. End your turn? I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the salamander. Okay. Vex, you're up. Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden?",MATT: You can roll a stealth check. A hide action
Stealth,"skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to hide. I'm pretty sure you have to... If you go from hiding to hiding, you can do it. You told me, I swear! Read the ability, read the ability! Okay, where was it? Right now, on the air. Okay, where is it? I don't know where it is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then I'll roll for stealth then if it works. I'll say for the sake right now of the distraction, go ahead and do it for now, and we'll correct it later if need be. I would rather you","have fun than not. So, what's your stealth roll?"

Performance,"right here, the zombie, can do a little break dancing, and then the skeleton can do a bit of the bird, and then maybe the worm. All right. As the skeleton leaps down into the worm (crash), just flat laid out, cracking part of its pelvis... Dancing without music. Yep. No music whatsoever. Is the zombie like (zombie groaning). The tip of his arm falls off at the ulna. Pop and lock! Pop and lock! All right. I'm going to go ahead and-- These guys are great! I'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a",performance check.
Stealth,"(singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing great! Yep, your name was in the song! (singing) Gern is my name and this is definitely the song that I'm singing. It's discordant enough that on a low wisdom save I'll say the fire elemental's next attack has disadvantage. That was the strangest round of combat I think I've ever had in D&D. All right, Percy, you're up. Follow that. First, top of your round, you take nine points of fire damage. That's halved to five. I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make a",dexterity (stealth) check to hide again.
Arcana,"is happening? Yes, you can do that. Can he push down? You can jump onto it and begin to push down. I'm going to push down with all my might, to try to get him down on the ground. You leap in the air and jump on it again and as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly, over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the point where you're over the orb on the very top, as you can feel the spell about to dissipate. Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole!","MATT: Grog, go ahead and roll an arcana check."
Athletics,"What are we trying to do, shove him back into the hole? Shove him in the hole! Grog, shove that fucking thing in there. He's over lava. You are made of hit points! All right, fuck it-- This is your thing. Can I do the vines from out of the portal? No, it has to have an anchor point somewhere. All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him straight toward the flaming vagina hole.","MATT: Okay, I want you to make an athletics check."
Acrobatics,"of your rage. Yeah, I'll use another one. Okay, you go into a rage. All right, as you step into the lava, you suffer 26 points of fire damage from wading up to your knees in molten rock. Halved. Halved because of your resistance. So 12. I rolled a 22. 22. With that you, (boof), you shove the sphere, which shifts back about halfway to there. You have to catch yourself on the side, grabbing the broom and holding it out here as you're stepping the other direction. I want you to make",an acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"it with this. With an app? With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait that's not what I wanted to do! Keep going! Distract him with your morning radio program! And that bit of chaos is just enough, as he begins to cast his innate Invisibility spell, it looks over. ""What in the-- Shit!"" And loses the spell concentration. The invisibility field vanishes, and it stands there above. All right, that brings us to Vax. Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over the lava pit.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check.
Deception,"As you're dealing with this, you have no notice of this. You may question it later, if you like, but you have no idea where it went, and didn't see any of this transaction happen. Oh no! Oh no! What, what is it? Your broom fell in the lava! What? I saw it! I just turned around for a moment! I tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava! Are you sure? Yeah!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Insight,"I just turned around for a moment! I tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava! Are you sure? Yeah! Make a deception check. You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast my spell! This is why I never looked at you before! I was wrong to doubt you! No! No, you're a constant source of disappointment! 18. Where's my fucking broom?",MATT: Make an insight check now.
Arcana,"You all have honest faces. Particularly her, over there. Very honest face. What can I do to help? What do you think would lend itself to a fire gate-sealing ritual? It could be a spell, it could be a use of a skill. How would you like to--? A candle? Do you have any candles that could aid? Like fiery candles, maybe? I have a-- No, this one casts-- This is bright light, there's a thunder candle. Blink candle. Destroy-- No, that destroys dexterity. I have a thunder candle, but I don't know if that would work.",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Nature,"I'm starting to think you're all very bad luck. However, that did aid the ritual. We have two more folks who could aid in this ritual. I can use-- I don't know if it will help, but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness that's precious. How would that help the ritual? I don't know. Am I a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too? Yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level Plane Shift to help smush it closed.","MATT: All right, go ahead and make a nature roll"
Acrobatics,"You don't know. You'll find out. However you wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would be helpful in this instance. There's something I could do. Yeah, spit it up. I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with that red cape. Hmm. Okay. Matador it. I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it. Okay. I will say-- hmm. How do I make this work? I'm going to want you to go ahead and make",an acrobatics check.
Investigation,"She's the nicest! At a level three for you! That's really nice of you. You're a really good person. I am! I am. 20 points. Holy shit! Vex? Yes? This gentleman has done nothing but aid us. I know, and it's so kind of him. He's suffered the loss of three of his-- Look at all these treasures he's going to find here for his candles! Is there anything we can do to repay you?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"Because it flies, Scanlan. What is it with you and flying? I don't know, there's just something about being up there in the air that makes me feel alive in a way that I've never felt before. I could make you fly. Okay. Wait-- Oh, you mean. With your cube. Yes, that's right. I'd rather you do it with this broom, actually. And not in any weird way, just to be able to help me make the broom fly. Do you know how to do that? I will try. I will examine the broom and make some sort of check on it.",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Investigation,"It's a number. 14. 14. Okay. Looking over the broom, you can tell it's enchanted. There are runes along the sides of the broom. You do gather from the nature of the enchantment that it is an item that requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to initiate its magic. Short of an Identify spell, you would probably have to guess. If you know the Identify spell, that would be a way for you to. I don't. Can I examine it to see if there's any markings, any hidden anything on it? Make an intelligence check. Or, you know what, this would be specifically investigation.",Investigation check.
Perception,"We could set an ambush later. Yeah! You guys begin to coast around the outside of Westruun, drifting up above as well, this wispy pattern of clouds. You get a view of the external farmlands that dot the north-northwestern side of Westruun. A number of them appear to have been burned. Not like forest fire or cataclysmic meteorite, like intentionally burned. The crops are charred and black, and there's a pattern to how that was set. A few farmhouses also appear to have burned as well. But there are farmlands that are also functional, and you can see people tilling the land. I want everyone to make a",perception check.
Stealth,"Oh, I'm reverting, too. I'm a follower. All right, Scanlan. Keyleth? I guess so. Wow, we're just going to make this super obvious, huh? There are dragons flying overhead. Well, we've landed. We're in a corn field. Yeah, we've landed. Let's do it. We all want to die. All right, so all of you, including Grog, or are you staying in your mist form? Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm changing. You all take a moment to revert to your physical form. I would like everyone to make a",stealth check.
Perception,"We've got to go get his kid. I feel like we have to help them. We have to help them! Oh man. I feel like you all are talking like I normally do, and I'm talking like Grog normally does. This is such a weird day. No, you're using way too many prepositions. You said there are a lot of people that look like me. ""From what I've seen. I don't go too far into town, they keep me out here, but I've seen a few."" I'm keeping an eye out for the guard. I want to keep an eye out for the guard, make sure he's not noticing.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"That's a bit obvious. Is it obvious? It's once he's inside the area, so it's not like the wall on the outside. Okay. I was picturing all the plants suddenly losing their shit. No, just the ones in the immediate vicinity. Like a used car lot? Okay, so he's going to attempt to make a strength saving throw. I'm going to squat at the edge of the high crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was walking off just to make sure he's oblivious.","MATT: Make a perception check, if you could, Vax."
Insight,"Other people haven't seen me. You like a good surprise, right, Horace? ""Yeah?"" Yeah. I thought you might. Here's my have you seen my cousin Zanror? Is he in the city? ""Probably, aye."" Right. And what about Kevdak? ""Kevdak stays in the city, as well. Up at the old Margrave's place, actually. Turned it into ""his palace. Want me to take you?"" Before we go any further, what do I roll if I want to find out if Horace really does like surprises? I'm not kidding.",MATT: Make an insight check. All of you guys are
Stealth,"if I want to find out if Horace really does like surprises? I'm not kidding. Make an insight check. All of you guys are still hidden, by the way, unless you want to do something. No, I'm just watching. And we gained another plus ten, so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way, from that Hide in Plain Sight. Wait, what? We have Pass Without a Trace, which adds plus ten, Hide in Plain Sight adds plus ten. That's what I camouflaged us fucking for. How do you have all these things?",MATT: All of you guys make another stealth check
Stealth,"game. Apparently, the shirt link wasn't working earlier, it is working now. They got it functional, so go ahead and hop on now while you can. Returning from the break, as Grog and Scanlan sit, waiting to hear back from the rest of the team, traversing over towards Westruun, seeking information in their mist forms. The two of you remain behind. The four of you guys who are in mist form, where are you going? Can we stealthily head towards a pocket of people? Do we see a crowd of people being held?

Perception,"slapped over. You can see what looks to be some sort of strings adorning edges of it, like decoration. You see, walking through this area, what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals of varying heights. Probably a good six or seven goliaths among them. Others appear to be human, half-orc, it's hard to make out the full details from this distance. They're all on the outskirts surrounding what was previously the Margrave's home. Now the homestead of Kevdak, seemingly. Can we see Kevdak anywhere? You have no idea what Kevdak looks like. I look for a bigger goliath than the rest, or one that looks older and bigger.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"to be entering or exiting. And the pace of those that are not of the herd that you see walking through the city has a feel of hopelessness, or at least their presence outdoors is more of function. They do what they're told, and if they're not, you've already seen what happens to them. Now what? Maybe stealth isn't-- maybe Grog's right-- we can't talk, can we? No, we're fucking clouds. Can we say go back to the-- Yeah, I'm gesturing to go. Get out. Yeah, let's go back.","MATT: Make a stealth check, guys, on the way out."

When next we see Pike, I'll ask her about it. Yeah. Find out if it's good or bad or neutral. Because I don't know anything about this. Right, I don't know anything about this?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Stealth,"Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to hear what they're saying. All right, all right. She can read lips so she doesn't even get that close. It's pretty dark, though. But I do have good darkvision. This is true. As the night takes over, it's still quite a distance to be able to make out a lot of detail. You'd probably have to get closer. But you're going alone?

The enchantment that surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be moved by such natural incursions. Everyone go",ahead and roll a perception check.
Investigation,"Grog touch it and see what happens. You guys approach, and as you're stepping through the snowfall, which right now is, for you, up to just past your knees, like the grass was. For Keyleth it's just up to your waist. Scanlan, you and Pike are both (grunting) like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each leap as you're having to find your way through this heavy snowfall. Do you guys want a ride? Yes, please. I pick up each gnome on my shoulders. Thanks, Grog! No problem!",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check as
Investigation,"Keyleth? What? Can you go lick that obelisk? Hell no. Why not? I know that one. But you should do it, Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the same way. But you should try it, it's crazy. Keyleth, that was very clever. How far are we? You guys are about ten feet from it. I'm going to just look around it for any traps.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Nature,"another large shape that is carved into it. Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off of it? Sure. As you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it, no heat being radiated. I pull out the hunk of Quall again. Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol. It does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity. Man, somebody does not like sculptures. That-- Those aren't sculptures.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?
Nature,"A name is earned? A name is earned. Oh, no. And beneath it, there is what appears to be-- the other large carving you saw on it-- it looks like a triangle. A dark, recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers internally into a point. It is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside. It is just an empty space that comes to a point. Oh, no. I think that there are basilisks nearby. Do I see any? I think these statues are victims.",MARISHA: Can I do a nature check? To see if I can

Perception,"is... first one is a 21. 21 hits. And second one is... 19? Hits. Third one is 16. Hits. These are not with Sharpshooter? No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine, plus ten. With that, your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage, and the creature slumps over on the ground, letting out a horrible, gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud. Daredevil. Was that all of them?","MATT: Currently, yes. Make a perception check."
Investigation,"Are you guys leaving? Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff! We got some! You're standing amongst the obelisk, a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together stone statues of people and pieces of people around. Do we want to check the other building ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a whole corner of a building over there. Sure. Well, go check it! I go look at it. Half-elves look at the building structure.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"Would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden? ""I don't want to stay here."" Then you come with us, and then you stay very, very hidden. ""I can do that. I can definitely do that."" When it's time, he can hide with the bear. Then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker, or most of a mapmaker. We'll be fine. Let's go. ""All right."" While all of that happened, for the last ten minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit?",MATT: Sure. Roll a stealth check.
Survival,"deal two points of damage to all of you as across your flesh being dragged through the bramble thicket. That's only your own self-loathing, Grizz, Jesus! Ow! I could use a writing utensil. Oh, that hurts. Until eventually Snizzler decides to rise up in frustration and take over the leader position. Jeez, all right, come on. Let me see. Here, take dick bone, that is the leader staff. All right, thank you. We got it from an old badger.",MATT: Go ahead and make your survival check.
Perception,"No, no, no, look: the Snizz can do a lot of things. The Snizz does not swim. Not very confident in my swimming abilities. I'm not sure the Snizz can do a lot of things! (thunder) Oh, Zarongel smiles on us again, yay. As you guys glance from the flash-- Smite another tree, Zarongel! Sorry. It's okay. You see the bolt of lightning strike a distant watchtower on the far side of the city that has a rod specifically to pull these types of things out of the way. Stupid idea. Glancing over, I'll have you guys roll a",perception check if you could. Everybody go ahead
Survival,"The disembodied voice makes a good point, let's go in the sewer. (laughter) Right! Let's drown rather than be stabbed! How are we going to cross? Drowning is the way Zarongel would want us to go out. I thought you were going to build us some flotsam-floaty-flotsam. I'm really nervous about water. I like burning things. I can carry you, I'm strong. I want to look around and see if there's anything to add to this flotsam pile.","MATT: Sure, make a survival check."
Survival,"I can carry you, I'm strong. I want to look around and see if there's anything to add to this flotsam pile. Sure, make a survival check. Can Snizzler and Mezek help me to-- Build a rough raft. Yeah, to build a rough raft. Seven. I roll as well. 17. MARISHA. What am I adding here? Don't I have good stuff for tinkering? Do you want to tinker? I think this is survival.","MARISHA: Oh, survival. Ten. But he rolled pretty"
Stealth,"17. MARISHA. What am I adding here? Don't I have good stuff for tinkering? Do you want to tinker? I think this is survival. Oh, survival. Ten. But he rolled pretty good. Okay, it takes you guys the better part of about 30 minutes or so as you find things in the nearby edge of the woods. You start pulling up the bits of clay and sand that you were buried under as something caught your foot, and it was a bit pointy but you found a chunk of driftwood that looks to have made its way there. I would like you all","to make a stealth check, as you are now having to"

So, at this point you guys watch as Grizznak spins around, points his staff forward, and quite a ways away you hear this boisterous (indistinct drunk storytelling) start blasting from the opposite side of the bridge, up near the rocks that begin to meet the base of the city's foundation. The footsteps shift and you hear them going across the wood planks above you on the bridge, in the direction that he set.

Perception,"things that might be useful or that can contain alcohol. Okay. Good to know. You guys step your way inside the sewer. The slick stone structure of it has lots of residue buildup from various minerals that have come through, as well as various degrees of wastewater that have found their way to the river. The smell is horrible for anyone but you guys. It's a familiar scent. As you make your way inside-- I'd say about 100 feet in as you're going through the darkness here-- but you guys can see fine in the dark, this is goblin speciality. Darkvision, guys. I check to see if there are any insects that are tasty-looking.",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"Wait, just to clarify, because I used my teeth, does that mean I ate poop to find the tunnel? Well, I hope you saved some for the rest of us! No, you had to smear it on your teeth a little. Pushing forward, you guys travel another 80 or so feet before you come onto a large series of waterfalls that run into a central open cesspool area that is down below this path. The actual path diverts and goes around this central tunnel before it continues in a singular direction as the water is pouring in. What do we see above?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"what little bit of light that is bouncing through from the surface and your goblin eyes catch this little glimmer in the corner and you glance over and instinctually run towards it. You go ahead and take a look. It's shiny. You find a hefty well-made human shortsword. Dibs. So it's a broadsword for you. Are you saying I'm small? I'm saying we're all small. Oh, right. What did you roll? What was the total on",your perception check again?
Survival,"This marrow's real good. You guys are missing out. Pass me a rib. Is there any of the armor that any of us can fit? You could try and pull scrap from it if you wanted to try and scavenge pieces of the metal. If we pulled the two shoulder pieces off, could we maybe tie them together and wear them like an Eat at Joe's sign? Could certainly try that if you want to, yes. I'm going to give it a roll. Okay. I will say for this-- you know what,",go ahead and make a survival check
Perception,"every time. There it is. 19. 19, okay. All righty, so as you go-- as you put your new shiny hat on and begin stepping forward across where the paths converge. You-- big, knees forward, stomping steps and you put your head forward and stop as there's a distortion in the air before you. And you breathe out, ""huh?"" and it (wobbling noise) quivers. Step aside, step aside! Grizznak the Great is here. Great. Let's get ready to be hit by lightning. Well. It looks like something wobbly, so it's probably magic.",MATT: You make a perception check.
Perception,"I'd say for that, go ahead and heal four points due to the rhythmic massage of Mezek's rough and tumble goblin hands. I would like to point out that you just healed me through a goblin shiatsu massage, that was amazing. Yes, yep that happened. With vomit-based massage oil! It's organic! Only the finest for you. I step up and I crack my back a little bit and okay. We're good to go. Let's do this. Do any of my flasks or jugs have any liquor in them?","MATT: No. However, make a perception check."
Perception,"runoff from some of the upper grate areas that are pouring in, it seems to be running to the edge. And you stumble a ways ahead before you find out that there, that drop-off that you noticed, you come up to it and it is indeed a drop-off. You glance down and the walkway you're at ends abruptly around a large cylindrical cistern-type chamber. Probably a good 80 feet across and about 80 feet down, further than your vision can really see. You don't see a bottom of it. You see (water falling). What does the loogie tell me? You spit out the loogie. Make a perception check.",IVAN: Loogie perception check.
Perception,"tunnel. No, no, no. Piglet managed to grab the very back of Grizznak and pull him back up. Damn, guys. We're badasses, just like we practiced. Good work. Grizznak, you're really frustrated because you swear you were this close to seeing when that thing would drop before you got pulled up. Guys, what's the big deal? I was almost there. I almost saw it. Oh, hi. No more saving you. I have an alternate plan. What if I throw one of you across to the other side? Hmm. I have another alternate alternate plan. I look to see if there is any way to climb up.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"20! A natural 20? 23 all together. It's the Golden Snitch, man. Don't fuck with the Golden Snitch. So you take this tiny goblin, lick your grimy finger, feel the wind, point Sir Ruth style and shotput. Snizzler arcs forward, much farther than you expected. Overward, you see in the distance-- rope not attached, by the way. You guys, it's beautiful from up here. Over. It comes up and you can see, you may or may not be close enough to the ledge, oh god, it's right there before you. Go ahead and make an",acrobatics check in the middle of the air to try
Acrobatics,"12. Oh no. Wait, is it song time? Is it song time? Song time. Sing your song. What? Am I falling now? It's up to you. If you want to let it go. You can sing your song and go for a reroll. I guess it's song time. As I'm still soaring, in my tiny voice, I say (sing) Snizzler, zazzlers, sizzler, zaz. Eyebrows this goblin once had. My bombs go boom, they never miss. Hi Homeland Security, because now I'm on the watchlist. It's funny because it's true. Yes. Yes, it is.",MATT: Go ahead and reroll that acrobatics check.
Perception,"This is totally logical. If it were church people, they drink a lot, so it should light up. Like the finest of candles, it does catch fire and begins to burn slowly. It's not dry enough to catch-- we're having this conversation. No, I'm really excited that this is a thing that's happening right now. It would need to be suitably dried out to work as proper fuel, but-- Definitely lots of alcohol, lots of drugs, yeah. I start packaging up some of the poop. All right. I look for any sort of egress.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"I look for any sort of egress. Make a perception check. Same. Why not, I'll do it too. 16. Eight. 18. All right. While you're collecting your filthy prize, both Piglet and Grizznek, you guys look up and notice that there is a wooden or stone ceiling, but a singular opening above you. Like a circular hole. First, I would like to listen to see if there's any stinky, stupid humans upstairs.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"can go scout it out. Right, Browntooth? If it keeps you from blowing things up, and you setting anything on fire. Right, I climb up and go out the outhouse to stealthily move into the street. All righty. So, as you-- Wait, wait, wait. I'm also going to cast Penumbra on him. Okay. So, Penumbra, it basically puts a permanent shadow on him. Oh. I thought it gave me a number from before. (laughs)","MATT: Go ahead and roll a stealth check, if you"
Survival,"All right. As you stumble into the shady alley, looking about, you glance over the side of the window real fast into the tavern, and you do see there are probably a dozen patrons in there. Some drinks being served, a guard at the door on the inside. However, looking to your left, there the alleyway spills out into a main street thoroughfare, and you can see people walking by, families with children. There's a general air of jovial energy to it, and some people are wearing flower crowns on their heads. You can see carts being put along the street. Seems like the festival you were told of, this terrible, human festival seems to be in full swing. Go ahead and",make a survival check.
Perception,"town, fish is a big export here. And the alleyways that you came out of? There is a second alleyway that offshoots from where the outhouse is that goes between the buildings off the main thoroughfare. This is what you're able to gauge in your time out here. I go back and tell them what I've seen. So everybody's going that way. We should probably go-- That way? That way. That way! Maybe if we get on each others' shoulders with a coat, we'll look like peoples!",ASHLY: I want do a perception roll for a big coat.
Perception,"14. You glance over the window and look inside. One of the bar patrons, sitting by the bar, is this rotund-looking gentleman in his late 40s. Balding hair, a double chin, leaned forward on the bar, looking like he's ready to pass out from the amount of alcohol he's been drinking. He is in the inside of the tavern. He has a very long coat that drapes past the bar. We got to do it! There's no alternative! There is an alternative! There's the little alleyway! No alternative! This is what we're doing. How many patrons are there? Do I get to know from",my perception check?
Perception,"There is an alternative! There's the little alleyway! No alternative! This is what we're doing. How many patrons are there? Do I get to know from my perception check? Glancing in there, you see probably ten patrons altogether. I look around. Do I see anything that looks like a children's clothing store? Maybe two of us can be a child and three of us can be an adult. If each one of us is a leg, and we're three goblins tall, that's six feet. Okay, yeah, no, you're right, Grizz.",PHIL: Look for a cow costume. Perception check for
Sleight of Hand,"side of us to try and knock it over. Mezek, you pull out your goblin jag star, which is essentially the equivalent of a shuriken, but it's carved out of pieces of odd, rusted metal that had been tied together. It's more of a cluster of broken whatever you found from a wagon wheel that was busted weeks ago, but you throw it as a ranged weapon. Roll an attack. That's 20. 20. A bottle shatters and sprays across the back of the barkeep who's like, ""Hey, what the ""hell is that?!"" Grab it! He seems currently distracted. The three of",you together make sleight of hand checks right now
Sleight of Hand,"So 11, then. 28. 19. Okay, you're all above a ten with two high rolls, that's good. You all leap up real fast, grab his coat, and pull it off of him before anyone seems to notice. I want to see if he's got anything on his belt like a pouch or anything like that. You glance, and there is a belt pouch there. I want to make a stab at grabbing and ripping it off. Don't get greedy!",MATT: Roll another sleight of hand check.
Stealth,"I want to make a stab at grabbing and ripping it off. Don't get greedy! Roll another sleight of hand check. We're goblins  of course be greedy! What am I rolling? This is another sleight of hand. 15. 15. Okay! You snatch it and all of a sudden you hear a voice from the front door go, ""Hey, ""what's that? I saw something! Is someone trying to steal from Zed?!"" You hear footsteps as somebody begins walking over to where he was right now. Go! We run?","MATT: You guys run? Make stealth checks, guys."
Perception,"Five. Five. One leg, whoa, goes forward, and you stumble and take a knee like you're kneeling in the middle of the street. And the man who holds the drink goes-- Kids, I want to talk to you about safe sex. I am reflecting upon the glory that is this most holy day-- Stop talking! ""Oh, you're one of them church types. Never mind."" And the guy stumbles off. At this point, you see the crowd starting to hush a little and gather towards-- Hup!",MATT: You get back up. Make a perception check if
Stealth,"Thursday night. It's a nice Sunday night right there. Top of the round. All of them charge into the square as the rest scattered. Bring this in here. Browntooth, you're up first. I look for some place to hide and head there as quickly as possible. Closest place to hide here would be behind this cart or behind the platform. Where are the attacking people? They're right here. Ah! There they are. I get behind the platform. You duck around here. Go ahead and roll a",stealth check to hide in the shadows.
Stealth,"The cleric. Go ahead and roll for attack. Ooh! 17 plus nine. 25. Yeah, that definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage with additional 2d6 sneak attack damage. Should I do them all at once? Yeah, do them all at once. (grunts) Seven. Seven points of damage to the cleric. The bolt strikes the back of the cleric's lower torso, the kidney area and she goes (grunts) and almost drops the holy symbol, catching it in the middle","of the air, looks around.

You can get there and see him off to the side. He's flanked, also. Why didn't you run, wizard? Am I flanking him? Roll a stealth to see if he sees you. He does not. He is so distracted with all his dead friends and being on fire, there's no way he can",beat your stealth score with a six he rolled.
Sleight of Hand,"etched into it. What does it say at the bottom there? You can do a rubbing on the front. It says ""How do you want to do this?"" But again, if you want to go full Gilmore, we have the Masterworks box, which is freaking gorgeous. The dice go in here, the Bluetooth is hidden in there. Bluetooth?! You'll never lose your shit. And then all your cards go there. Put your weed in there. You're not supposed to just come out and say it.",TRAVIS: Can I do a sleight of hand roll?
Deception,"What? No, don't-- I take it back and I give another dagger to him. I give him the Keen Dagger and say, hold this. It's a loner. It's very sharp. Be careful with it, all right? If you get caught on your own, stab. That's all you got to do, is stab. Stab the other person, not yourself. His eyes don't leave the blade and he goes, ""Okay.""

One dryad dies a horrible screaming death. (screams) And the other one you hear is breathing heavily from the inside right now. Keyleth is standing at the edge of the forest going-- At which point, a bunch of the orcs turn around. I need both of you guys to-- let's see, because they're making active perception. What was","your stealth check, Sam?"
Deception,"but didn't quite take away from the moment that you just got to enjoy. I took eight points of damage? Nine points of piercing damage. All right, that ends that orc's turn. This one, the one that seems more decorated with the gem-encrusted headband runs out and starts shouting orders. Did the two that were on me attack? He's going to come forward and begin to attempt to attack your orb as well. All three strike at the orb, trying to cut through. Can I act like they're hurting me? If you want to. Ugh! Ah! Ooh! Oh!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Acrobatics,"collapsing into one of the campfires and it begins to burn. Sorry, sweetheart. And I feel the dagger go-- Yep, to the side of your Blinkback Belt. All right, do you want to stay right there? You have more movement if you want to use it. How much left? Like five or ten? Three more squares, 15 feet. I'm going to walk up right up next to Keyleth in front of the bear. One, can I go diagonally? Through the fire, you can if you want to. Yeah, yeah.","MATT: Make an acrobatics check, go for it."

And I take out Craven Edge. I walk up to the orc that she's holding. And I put him in a nice little sleeper hold. Yeah, look, mate. So unless you want to bleed or lose the head that's attached to your body, are there more of you around these parts?",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Stealth,"bed, swing by on a broom or something. I like it. I'll hop on the broom. Okay. Wait, check it out and then? Your door is stationary, though, right? The door is stationary, the door is on the outside of this camp. But everybody inside's safe. Yeah. Do it. Can I stealth in the air? Not really. Can I wrap myself in like my-- What?

(unnervingly realistic crow noises) Perfect. Wow. Thank you. So as you continue cresting over the top of the tree ridge, heading towards the direction that Keyleth points out to you, you guys swoop down.

At that point, you're in complete darkness right now, you can see a faint distant bit of light that's barely creeping in from the entrance you came from. Around you, though, nothing. I'll break form and come back as Scanlan. Okay. You come back as a gnome.

Technically, Scanlan flew in, so I don't think he had to check for traps. I did not check for traps, I just flew in, but perhaps we should this time. Lead me in as far as you went. If you'll check for traps. Yeah. Where you flew over, yeah. Yes, let's do it. In the entrance and down those stairs. All right. So go ahead and make an",investigation check.

Lead me in as far as you went. If you'll check for traps. Yeah. Where you flew over, yeah. Yes, let's do it. In the entrance and down those stairs. All right. So go ahead and make an investigation check. 20. No, 17. 17. I will also check for traps.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"water-like movement, and as you hit the bottom of the stairway and it evens out into these square stone tiles across the way, you see ahead of you what looks to be a singular circular room with no exits from what you can tell at this point. Just a circular room that loops around, and in the center there is a ten-foot pool of a still, somewhat still surface of water. There is a little bit of movement because there is some sort of a cold breeze that was ejecting out of the tunnel, but there is no real source of the wind that you can pick up at the moment. Can I investigate the walls? Did you already check for traps in this room?",LIAM: I did an investigation check.
Perception,"""Knowledge dost billow, all realms are the shore. The sky a window, the water a door."" Yep. So in this room, it's a circle, what's the distance across the room? It's about 30 feet across on a side. Oh, so it's not that big. And it's a ten-foot pool. No, it's a pretty tight space. And there's solid flooring and then the pool in the middle. Yeah, in the middle, so you move around. So a ten-foot walkway around it. Can I get on the broom? And fly up above the pool of water and look down into it?",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"Two? Okay. Yours is five, right? For the constitution modifier? Oh, sorry, no, I'm being a dickhole. It is five, yeah. Yeah, so you can hold your breath for five minutes. Five minutes! Is that however long your-- Yeah, one minute per constitution modifier. For you it's two. Interesting. After you've landed here, you're about 30 seconds in, looking around, Grog's there. How far does the tunnel look?","MATT: Make a perception check, with disadvantage"
Investigation,"darkvision, you look around and you see what appears to be a smooth, marble stone floor, very intricately carved, with four pillars surrounding the exit of the pool that you guys came out of. You can see on each of these pillars, facing inward, or not inward, sorry, facing outward of these pillars, what looks to be these stone lion heads. They each face outward. The chamber is also circular, but much larger, it's actually 60 feet across, from the 30 feet of the first chamber you came to. Right where we are, I'm going to take my Flametongue dagger and go in a circle and detect traps. Detect some traps.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"beautifully painted image shows flames twisting and writhing in an arced pattern that then twist into broken rock and soil and earth and mountains that then break once again, sinking into an angry ocean, and that ocean then begins to rise into clouds into the sky, those clouds then dissipating and turning into raw flame and continuing the loop. It's the water cycle. Elements. In the center of this loop, there is a single dark hole in the ceiling. I'm flying, so I'm up near it. Can I investigate it?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Religion,"understand with your knowledge of Draconic, however that is the base root of this writing, as ancient as it is. Pike? Does this mean anything to you? By the way, Matt, I rolled my second natural one of the night for my intelligence check. Okay. You have no idea what this is about, yeah. I'm trying to get water out of my ear. Pike's looking up and says, ""This is beyond me, this is very old."" Does this harken back to anything that we remember about the telling of the Spark, or the Second Spark?","MATT: You know, I'm going to make a religion check"
Investigation,"""out of that chaos when the gods came, just like we were told at the Platinum Sanctuary. That's what ""you told me you found there."" All of the elemental realms overlap, which create our realm. Which is why there's gateways. Can I walk over to one of the pillars? Yeah. Is it covered with anything? They're all the same, and they all have that giant gold stone lion head facing outward from each of the pillars. Is there writing or anything fancy on the pillar?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"I'm okay. Well I go down and I grab Pike then and I go up on the broom. Okay. Pike goes, ""Thank you!"" You grab her and she holds onto the edge of the broom and you guys make it up that way. No, since the hole is just small enough where you pretty much have to go through single-file, so nobody else can climb while you're doing that. You guys go through, who's coming up first? I'm flying. You fly up after them. Who's going up first? I'll go up next.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Athletics,"19, okay. Making your way up. It's a long pull. I'm going to Batman. All right. Who's up next? I'd like to use acrobatics to ignore the rope and use the sides of this little tunnel to do that going up. Okay, okay, go ahead and do that. That is 25. 25, okay, that keeps you going. So you guys get up a third of the way, who's after you? I guess I'm climbing the rope. There's a rope, yes? Climbing that rope.",MATT: Yep. Make an athletics check.
Athletics,"13. 23. 23. You guys make it up two-thirds of the pathway, now. You can see now the sand has reached the bottom, and at this point, you guys who made it up to the top, you look up as you notice part of the stonework above goes (fwsh) and sand begins to now fall directly on top of you guys, pushing past you. I need you guys to make one more check, with disadvantage because of the sand, because that was what the time limit was going to do. It's gone, it's gone! As soon as the timer went out, that was when the top one went boom, and capped off the top.",SAM: This is an athletics check?
Investigation,"do. Jeez, it would've been better if we would've just gone up the hole. Yeah. Fuck, I've never rolled that well in my life. That was the time to do it, man. So you guys now see there is a long stone brick hallway before you. It's solid behind you, with a little bit of sand that's now coasted from the corner after Pike had diverted it briefly. Beyond the way, about 30 feet ahead of you, you see two metallic doors that are closed. Traps, I'm looking for traps.",MATT: Investigation check.
Perception,"able to really see it. Is it the exact same in both doors? Yes. Not a mirror image, not one blue one green? No, it is the exact same. Okay. Should we open a door? Well, do you want to bust out those Ioun stones you have? Maybe there's a clue in here. You also have your Ioun stones. Yeah, but what's that going to do? In the walls and in the floors and in the ceiling, is it just the same marble and stone, are there any porous openings or--?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"All right. I'm a little better at being invisible, but go for it. Which door? Both of them. Both doors (creak) open. You look into what appears to be a, from what you can see, because there is a very, very faint bit of light emanating from his dagger, but beyond that it is pitch darkness. Percy is the one who cannot see. What do you see, Percy? I see a door that I have conquered. (laughter) That was good. It was great. Do I need to make another",stealth check at this point?
Perception,"All right, so I'm going to-- Just stay back, there's no point in all of us getting with something. And I move 20 feet ahead of everybody. You move 20 feet ahead. You enter the room and you can see this chamber is square in size, but it is divided, it seems to be in three halls. There's a path to the right, a path to the left, and a path ahead of you. You can't quite see all the way past, the hallway continues to the very edge of your visual range once you enter the chamber. However, what you can see is to the right and left of you parts of the wall have collapsed, like there's piles of rubbles and stone and earth.",Make a perception check at this point.
Investigation,"sort of divot or bowl on the ground. I think you can all come in. Quietly. I walk up next to him. Oh yeah, I see what you're talking about. Yeah. Upon hearing this, Keyleth drops to her knees and does a Locate Creature. Do I sense any spiders? You actually do not sense any spiders. I think we're good on spiders. This thread is silk, isn't it? It's actual material. I'm not going to touch it. Conscious of the creation of air currents, I'm going to gingerly put on my mask so that my breath does not move things, and examine.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"That's okay. Is there any way to cross the room without touching the web? Yeah. Essentially, it's a 15, 20-foot wide thing, the web only starts about partway and encompasses the side of it. And is there anything behind the webs? Just rubble? Behind the webs, the hallway continues and then ends and then continues right. It's almost like it's a square room that has walls here that split it into three different passages and they all converge again on the opposite side. Can we see all the way to the end?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"I push Scanlan a bit up ahead of me. So this is going over the firepit, past the wispy-- Yeah, there's all the stuff on the sides and the central room has that pit. Hold your breath as you pass the wispy wisps, I don't trust them. Get that silver tongue of yours ready, all right? I don't think anything's going to want to talk to us down here. Can we look at the ground for (laughs) for traps as we're walking? Any squares that might move?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Fucking Dwarven Forge, man. All right, so that brings us to 15 to ten? 14. Grog. Anyone else? Seven. Oh, and Pike is actually before Grog. All right. Percy, you're up first. He hasn't attacked us. What is his name, Percy? Atreyu. I hate you. I'm going to pull back to the water pit to my right. Oh, to my left, sorry. I'm going to pull back to that water pit. I'm going to examine it.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Religion,"And I shout out, Pike, do you know the names of the four ancient gods? Is your name four? That's stupid. There doesn't seem to be a reaction. Pike goes, ""No, I mean, the gods that were at the ""beginning, there's--"" Yeah? ""There was Pelor and Melora and, I mean, they're the ones who cast away the elements, the ""chaos that this realm was first. I don't know!"" And she seems-- she's bungled and unable to really formulate what you're asking. I wouldn't have any religion, anything to base that off of?",MATT: Make a religion check if you want to.
Investigation,"roll damage. That's 13 points of damage. Okay. You cut through some of the threads, it limps on one side, but it's still keeping itself aloft. 19. All right, that hits, go ahead and roll damage. Ooh. 15 points of damage. 15 points of damage. All right. With that, the second strike, the thread dissipates and turns into smoke and vanishes from existence. None of the threads remain, it vanishes. Is there anything written on the wall?",MATT: Go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Perception,"time. You know what? It doesn't specify. I'll say go ahead. It starts at the top of the initiative round, so you know what? Vex, your turn, go for it. Go for it. Doesn't specify, I could be a dick about it, but you know. I take back my glare. It's more fun to not have your turn lost. There was a time jump so the glare never happened. What you got? Can I look up at the ceilings and see if there's any portals on the top of the ceiling like there were in the last room?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Persuasion,"Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously) No! It's not stupid! Okay, okay. Then I reach into the Bag of Holding and I get out Grog's cask of ale. Okay. And--? And what do you do with it? Okay. I pour a little in his mouth. Just a little bit, so he doesn't choke. (laughing) You reach over and you grab the edge of his beard and pull his mouth open, it's hanging limply. You pull off the cork of the cask and begin pouring it and it spills down the side into the snow, darkening it on the sides of his head. I turn his head so he doesn't drown in it.",MATT: Understood. Make a persuasion roll.
Religion,"Okay. The ale seems to slide back into the throat and find its way in towards the stomach. There is no swallowing motion whatsoever, but it appears that at least it's not drowning him or blocking his airway. You're clutching onto the spirit here. You only have a few moments left before the magic is lost. Who wishes to-- While that's going on I walk off 30 feet away and I fall to my knees on the ground facing away. I know you are not what I want. But you are what we need. And I will put aside my reservations and serve you. It is too soon for him, we need him. He is needed. I will set aside my reservations and serve you. Please.",MATT: Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Arcana,"But I can't help again? If you wish to do your own thing, you can. Just for extra, yeah. The sword seems to want power and strength. I don't know if it will help, but maybe if we gave Grog some extra strength it might help him to come back, so. I have a Potion of Fire Giant Strength. I could cast an Enhance Ability spell. He has no abilities now, though. That's true. So I'm going to pour this Potion of Fire Giant Strength into his gullet. Okay. Hope it gives him some sort of strength.",MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Insight,"grip, head beet-red as you notice that your thumbs are pressed into his larynx. No, no. No. (clears throat) What'd you do to me? (gasps) Nothing. What the fuck is that sword, Grog? Gave you some ale. What's with you and gnomes today, man? I like gnomes, I don't know! What? Why am I down here? Are we sure it's him? Scanlan? Percy? Percy, are we sure? Nope! I'm not sure. I'll do a perception check to see if it's--",MARISHA: Can I also do an insight check? Can I
Insight,"No, no. No. (clears throat) What'd you do to me? (gasps) Nothing. What the fuck is that sword, Grog? Gave you some ale. What's with you and gnomes today, man? I like gnomes, I don't know! What? Why am I down here? Are we sure it's him? Scanlan? Percy? Percy, are we sure? Nope! I'm not sure. I'll do a perception check to see if it's-- Can I also do an insight check? Can I assist him or make an insight as well?",MATT: You can make your own insight check.
Survival,"don't know about, you can always go to people with those abilities and be like, could you see what the fuck this does? Do any of our people have Identify? Negative. It's like a wizard thing. I didn't even know people could do that. Allura or Gilmore could probably do that for you. Don't act like you know for sure. (laughter) I know about Gilmore. Such a twinsies. Aw, so good. All right, so. You guys start heading northward, you're leading then, Vex? Make","a survival check. Technically in the forest, since"
Stealth,"thing we do. Yeah, only if it's close, otherwise I'm good to go back to Westruun. Only if the lake was close, I don't know where it is. Are you in a hurry to talk to Dad? Oh. We don't have to stop there, that's fine. Maybe later. I mean, do you need to talk to Dad? No. We do not need to talk to Dad. Let's go to Westruun! Westruun it is! Sore spot. Continuing pushing forward, I'd like you all",to make a stealth check.
Stealth,"We're keeping a good distance, as we get closer, so it lasts, I cast Pass Without a Trace on us. We have that really nice high grass, right? It was like waist-high or so. Not like cornstalk high. There were areas where there was, like during the thick farmland, there are areas where they have high-stalk. I'd like to stay there, I'd like to stay in those areas. Okay, so you'll be pretty much dodging from farmland to farmland, on the outside. I need you","all to roll stealth checks, if you could?"
Perception,"19. Oh. 29. 24. 33. 30. 32. 23. 20. All right. We're quiet. He rolled anyway. All right, as you guys leap into the high grass, moving around the outside of Westruun, eyes peeled, as the sun sets and the night kicks in, you try your best to watch for any patrols that",are keeping an eye. Make a perception check.
Stealth,"Reggie. Reginald, sorry. Can we sneak there, can Vax sneak there? What was the man's name who we killed? Oh, that you killed? Horace. No no no, the goliath. Horace. Vax, can you go get Horace's head? Okay, that's a good idea. Yeah, I can get that. I take that back, that's a great idea. I don't know why, but I can get that. So you're heading forward to do that? I rolled a better stealth than him, though.",MATT: Make a new stealth check. As you guys hold
Perception,"Oh, that's so much better! No, it's good. 39. 39, okay. So as you guys wait in the back, staying low to the grass, you watch as Vax dives into the field and vanishes. You, darting in a forward way, find your way to the outside of the initial crop-grid. There does not appear to be any guards that are watching this property. You recall the various avenues you guys utilized in systematically making your way from path to path. It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to find an area that looks familiar enough where you find your way into the center of one of the crop lanes where the corpse of Horace recently was.

At the moment? No. The patrol's probably a good ten minutes before it's seeming, because it's headed in the direction where you are but you don't know, probably take ten or 15 minutes before they reach where you are. I'm going to stealth up to the body. Cut him down. Okay. Cut the ropes off, he slumps down. I shoulder him back to the group.",MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check with
Stealth,"two hours. Uh-huh, and I can concentrate on a 40-square-foot for ten minutes. And each ten minutes I can change it. If you're doing a 40-foot square it could be like 20 feet lower for every 40-foot square you can do, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So real deep. Okay. So we'll say over the two-hour period you could create, for a 40-foot square, like a hundred feet deep, 120 feet deep-- I want to make sure it's wide enough to cover the whole entrance as well. The whole entrance? Okay. So you dig",underneath. Stealth check to get close enough.
Stealth,"rugged-looking, possibly members of the secondary tribe that they adopted, as was mentioned when you first inquired about the tribe as it currently stands, the Herd. They're all just looking out, bored, one of them is chewing on some dried meat, and they're just keeping an eye out. Scanlan, you've gone invisible and you're approaching the front gate. What are you doing? Hey, can you cast Pass Without a Trace on me? I already did! Okay, good. I'm just going to walk in, straight into town. Okay. Yeah. Just for the sake of this, go",ahead and make a stealth check. With advantage.
Perception,"been set. Some of them, you do notice as you pass by, large elements of the buildings have just dissolved, melted down by some sort of chemical reaction. Many buildings still stand. You do see that there are broken barrels and crates in the streets, it looks like a lot of what may have been in storage or being brought around as commerce has been ransacked and raided or relocated. You do see a couple carts that are half-broken or just up on the side, with whatever's on the inside pulled out. You do manage to see a couple of horses that were killed during some altercation that were just left rotting in the middle of the street. There are no people visible on the street. Make a",perception check.
Stealth,"I'm gonna take a minute to-- anybody standing near me, I'm gonna take a minute and use, um... Where's my thing? I'm freaking out! Hide in plain sight? All righty.

Perception,"or in the approach, so, yeah. Okay, so add 10 to that. 35. 35! Oh, look at that. Hopefully that's enough. It's like that scene in Willow where-- All right, um, since we're birds. I want to take it, just an occasional high-level... Circle around? Circle around, just to see what's up. Okay, both of you guys",roll perception checks.
Stealth,"(gasps) Giant eagles? Okay, I'm gonna go find a perch on the other side of the gate. And I'm gonna find a nice little sniper's nest. I'm assuming you have some clan members who might be druids, do you know? You're speaking really smart right now and it's confusing me. (laughing) Make sure you're hiding, Keyleth. I want to stealth, I kind of want to hunker down against the wall and stealth.",MATTHEW: Roll a stealth check.
Deception,"it's gonna take you a little bit to get there. Yep. They get back up to the top. They spend most of their turn getting to that edge, and taking a few steps away from it, getting their weapons out and kind of glaring at each other and trying to figure out what the hell they can do right now as you start looming towards them. I, unarmed, start walking towards them. And I say, ""Where is Kevdak?""",MATTHEW: Make a deception check.
Athletics,"It might be, I think it's like 30 feet, I can't remember. Or maybe it's 20, I can't remember. It's a little less than that, we'll see. Oh, is it? We'll see. At least you made it interesting. So shoving a creature, you can... Shove it... 9700 feet, specifically. All of them, all the feet.

Acrobatics,"I'm gonna do that, for sure. Can I use acrobatics? You, this more of a, this isn't acrobatics, this is more of a jump.

And leads out into-- Sort of like this? Or is it? No, it's up like this, it's vertical. Vertical. And what do we see past the bars? You see the open plains south of Westruun. No sign of tracks, anyone huddled for safety? I mean, looking around you can see a few footprints, scattered footprints, you can make a",survival check.
Perception,"spell do you have prepared that'll help with this, if any? That you have prepared. Where'd it go, where'd it go, it was right-- Can I-- There's a level one spell, Detect Good and Evil, if you have that prepared, that would detect for an evil entity. Do you have Identify?

Perception,"I give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek. Okay. I kick the dirt a little bit and then I walk away and I click my heels. Little jump-and-click. And-- anything else, before the evening's rest comes? All right. Sleep finds you all, some easier than others, until a measured period of time, I believe? Yeah.

It's a slightly more complex version of something you could make in the woods to catch birds. I'm just building a really big version. It's a whole bunch of systems like this that will have chains and weights on them that when you disrupt the weight at the center the whole thing goes clunk, throws a whole bunch of-- it's basically a netting system.

Ten feet into the ground, which we can-- Do it right now. Ready? I'm going to do another Stone Shape spell into the ground. You have to go around and find an area, because a lot of it's dirt.

Survival,"in between it? Taliesin, how does it work? Let's just keep him right off to the side because if that trap triggers-- In theory, he should be able to fit right at the sides of it, because it's got an armature spring system. As long as you're not in the way of the armatures, you should be fine. So you set it up and away, laying the sides down, precariously putting the pins in, holding it in an open position.

Athletics,"contest and they said no professionals! (laughter) Just enough of a distraction in the settling dirt for the dragon to turn its head over and its tail swings just a little wide of you, Grog, as you sidestep, no effect. We'll say for this, it's less of a surprise round. I use surprise round liberally. Surprise was it grappling and everyone getting out of it and preparing for the actual assault. It's more of a surprising round. Correct. Umbrasyl does get a turn. Umbrasyl, very frustrated and angry at the circumstance, is going to attempt to break free. With disadvantage",on the athletics check to try and break out of the
Stealth,"You didn't start the round hidden, so you can't do that. I wasn't still hidden? No, you have to spend a bonus action to attempt to hide at the end of your turn. Can I attempt to hide? You'd have to be a level two rogue to do that as a bonus action on your turn. But on my boots of haste I can use it to dash, disengage, or hide. Oh, you're using your bonus action-- so your extra action, not your bonus action. Okay, my extra action. You can do that, yes. Go ahead and roll a",stealth check.
Athletics,"Yes, I have two questions. One of the things I picked up from Kevdak were four enchanted javelins. What do those do? They're thrown, ranged attacks. And they're just enchanted? They're plus one to hit and damage. Just that. That's it, yeah. It's a relatively simple enchantment. What is my climbing speed? If my natural speed is 50 and I wanted to climb that column, what's the climbing speed? Climbing speed? I mean, if you roll a decent climb check-- here. That would be-- I'd say that",would be an athletics check to see if you can
Athletics,"climb it, and I'd put it at about half speed. But you're also prone, so getting up from that's half your speed. On my back, can I use my bonus action to drink the potion of speed, which makes me hasted? Yes you can. You now have technically four attacks per round. I do. And it doubles my speed, right? Yes. Okay, so I have 100 feet, so can I stand up? Yep. 50 feet. Can I try and climb that column towards Umbrasyl's feet?",MATT: Athletics check.
Athletics,"You can get up to there. You're wider than the pillar, though. You like-- Earthglide to the top, so it's 30 feet tall. (nervous laughter) And I'm going to use my momentum to see if I can rocket myself out and see if I can jump and grab onto his leg. Okay, so you're making this a jump action, then? Yeah, I want to shoot out of the pillar. Using the momentum of the Earthglide? And shoot out with a waterslide trajectory, woo! Yeah? Maybe? Okay. I'll say that-- It's pretty fast-- Also pretty heavy as an earth elemental. I'm thinking about it real hard.",MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Perception,"down. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact with the ground, leaving a small crater. However, there are two giant eagles that are now floating in the vicinity around the dragon. The eagles are summoned. Their initiative is not bad. They're going to be after Grog. Okay. So they're above his head now, so if he shoots acid down, they'll be here. And their command is, attack his eyeballs. Okay. I'm going to use my boots of haste. For my perception, would I be able to see any weird little bumps on the dragon? Because my brother's been in there a while. Can I see anything going on?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Do recall, you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off beforehand. Right, yeah. So you go into a rage. Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good? It doesn't help with that, no. All right. So I go in a rage, and I would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to Umbrasyl.","MATT: Okay.

That has gone away, unfortunately. Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain!",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Athletics,"15? Yeah. There's just not enough strength to get it though. You try and pull upward and the blade comes loose, comes towards your body, but doesn't actually find any additional part of the muscle to cut through. Dagger on the outside is 21. 21? Just scrapes across the hide. Not strong enough to pierce it from the outside. You do also take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more. Scanlan!

That is ten points of damage with poison on it. It's a DC of 15 for poison. I'm sure it makes it. Yeah, it makes it. It would've had to roll a one to not make it, unfortunately. Could I add one bonus thing at the end of mine? Sure. Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all? Or is the world just a clusterfuck?","MATT: Make a perception check, just glancing"

So Trinket's going to go ahead and--",roll a perception check for Trinket.

Thank you, that clarifies it. I was like, I don't see this in the College of Lore! You're confusing me! So as a War Caster, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack.

Okay, it's about 15, 20 feet up from the water's surface. All right. I stand up on the broom. Ceiling's right above you. You're having to hunch forward a little bit.

As you can only take the amount of gold that you retrieved, and the items you could farm, the rest will have to be left behind, hopefully to be retrieved at some point down the line by either the remnants of Westruun or yourselves.

But you do feel through this trip that you've definitely made an impact, and most of the people, at least over the next week or so, will be outfitted with the proper materials, food for the journey, and be able to make their way back towards Westruun.

In all the hubbub that's going on in Westruun, I spend some time to find my sister, and I wanted to stealth up on her.

Looked around real quick. Is there anyone in the hallway?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Do we see any golf carts or our cars left?",LIAM: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"No, it's the fake Brooklyn building. What do you want to climb? Whatever's sturdy! I don't know what's sturdy. What looks the sturdiest? You can certainly have a go, was that it? You can certainly have at it! Fake Town is like a canyon covered in green. The tower is a hump. There are plenty of vines on it. You could give it a try, try and climb up a vine. I'm pretty good at climbing. It's less scary than the absolute straight up. Yeah, I'm going to try to climb the thing.","LIAM: All right, make an athletics check."
Survival,"Part of the problem is that the vines are breaking away in your hand, so you can't get a firm grip on it. See? It looks a little dangerous. I don't know if you should go up there.

Investigation,"Noah's coming. Should we try to get outside and see what's in the cafeteria? Yeah, of course. How close are we, at this point? Super close. You're just in the building one or two doors down. We've got to climb down? And do we have to traverse ooze to get to it? I don't know. Got to get out there. Is there anything linking the rooftops of the two buildings? Any old power lines or power poles that may have fallen over? This is not Tomb Raider.","LIAM: You could make an investigation check, I"
Athletics,"So maybe we should just get down to the ground. Okay, but before we go, Laura, grab that dagger of yours. Why don't you cut off that vine? That way we'll have at least a rope we can use for something. Good fucking call, Sam! I cut some vine off, and I wrap it up like a little whip on my side, there. I have a jump rope in my gym bag. Okay. That's six feet, right? Eight feet? Yeah, it's like seven. No, six feet. How long's this vine that we can cut down here?",LIAM: Everybody make an athletics check on the way
Survival,"So now you have a rough idea of where it was. It wasn't exactly dead center. It was past center from where you guys are. All right. So wait, there's no ooze? Not as much. From where he's standing, all he sees is green. If you look to the right, you do see there's schmear on the sides of the canyon walls. Like, bagel schmear? Yeah. No. Snot from the sky. Are there any loose pieces of wood sitting around in the building? Can we rip some of the siding off?",LIAM: Make a survival check.
Perception,"dimensions of these canyon walls, you're like, I think that the commissary is over this way. You start to make your way through there, and as Sam is stepping, a snap. You step on something that snaps like a twig, and you hear all around you, rustling.

Medicine,"I have an arm again? Yeah. Damn, that Matt is so powerful. Level 20, yo. He was at level 20?! Fuck. He needs to be nerfed. Am I too close for a ranged weapon attack? No, you're not too close, but you probably want to get clear of Laura. Don't hit me. Not knowing what's going on with Laura, I'll use my movement to quickly give her mouth to mouth. Because I think she's frozen. She might be hyperventilating.","LIAM: All right, make a medicine check."
Deception,"My parents did a number on me. I think I'd be okay. I would hide. I wouldn't have gone out anywhere, really. My parents assumed I was gonna usher in the apocalypse.

So we have to pass a dusk, at least. That could be years. It could. Do you think it's safe if I fly up and look at the sky? No, but you might as well. Nothing's safe. Do I see any birds or anything like that in the sky? Any wildlife? Any critters?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"here within this part of the Feywild. I'm going to try flying up. All right, I'm going to try flying up above the canopy. Okay. You come up above the canopy. Have to maneuver around some of the larger branches, and these trees are tall. You probably get yourself a hundred feet up before you finally break the canopy, and as you coast over the top you can see now before you, this forest is vast. The majority of it behind you, and you can actually see what appears to be the edge of the forest's line maybe about ten miles up, and past that you can see rolling grass hills before a mountain line. You can see in the distance, a very far",distance-- make a perception check.
Perception,"dangerous it probably is, and the older it is, the more dangerous it probably is. What, things get prettier as they get older here? That's not fair. Just the men. Damn it.

At the pace you guys are walking, you just begin to push outside of the trees. It was hard gauging the distance from that period of time  that was the rough estimate based on the",perception roll. You begin to watch the tree line
Perception,"that was the rough estimate based on the perception roll. You begin to watch the tree line thin a bit. There's still many trees around you, but the density's beginning to scatter, and you're beginning to see more and more light let through from the treetops, and the trees themselves are not as tall as they were towards the central bulk of the forest. Vex, you do catch to your left side something that sounds like at first a little hiss, but instead it comes to your ear as a chuckle. Hello? What? Did you hear something? Is somebody there?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"We still haven't hit that tree line? You're past the tree line. You're in the grass, but it's hard to really gauge, since you have no sun in the sky and you don't have a central timepiece of any kind. Do we feel tired? Well, hold on. Can I spin around and see if the grass we've been trampling on is leaving a trail? No. None. No trail. It's like you never stepped through behind you. The grasses parted where you walked through, and then, looking behind, it's like you were dropped in the middle of a field. Is anything following us?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Every so often, you see these gates embedded in the wall, housing a massive emblem of a crescent moon flanked by two trees over a deep cerulean stone about two feet across. Twins, you know these as the threshold crests. These are the enchanted crests that enable the city to travel back and forth between the Feywild, should it be necessary. They're powerful, and they're rarely utilized, as the journey is not always accurate. It seemingly did so this time.","Make a perception check, guys."

Perception,"or four inches into the ground. Say (hacking spit). (hacking spit). It lifts up and pulls you guys slowly out of the sludge, (squelch) finally freeing yourself, and you're now hovering a very short distance above the ground. So at least you guys and me aren't slowed down, so that's good. Bye, guys! By the way, now that we're out of all this shit, can we look around and see if Ukurat has been peeping us this entire time? Can we see him?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"He's following you. So he's going to be able to get across all these rivers? Apparently, he's fine. He's pretty cool. He can jump really far. I give him a-- from a distance.

Well no, we can go from tree branch to tree branch. Are they tightly enough connected that we can travel on the top of the trees? Possibly. Might require some jumping. I am a backpack right now. I'm gonna get on the broom and fly up. You fly up. I'll climb after her.","MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check,"
Athletics,"Anime shit. Oh yeah. So if I can go ahead and get Grog and Percy to go ahead and make three successive athletics checks, if you could. With advantage? This would be, for you it would be advantage, yeah. What's the modifier for king of the apes? You know what, I'll give you advantage on this just 'cause you're an ape. Athletics or acrobatics? Um. For the purposes of climbing and grabbing,",I would say this is more of an athletics check.
Perception,"That's a long time. All right. I go ahead and I take off with Scanlan and do kind of a high aerial loop around the tree. (worried noise) All righty. Oh jeez, around the tree? Around it? Just at the top, really high. Really high, getting nice-- I wanna kind of perch on top of a tree nearby and just kind of see it from there. Watch. I want to see if I can find the source of the bog muck.",MATT: Okay. You both make a perception check from
Perception,"Out of the actual tree. Like even the top of the tree and stuff. Like evil maple syrup. Evil maple syrup, yeah. Mm, sounds tasty. Can-- Like ghostbusters. -- we see any kind of movement, any kind of things moving around the tree? You don't see anything moving around the tree at the moment, other than just the gentle swaying as a little bit of wind hits the sides of it, portions of its long hundreds and hundreds of hanging vines just kind of slowly get moved and tangled by the windfall. If you want to make a",perception check as well.
Perception,"just making sure they're not following us or anything? No, although if you find a log approximately two feet thick, I could certainly use that. A log? A log, about two feet thick. About how long, though? Doesn't matter. You wanna fly down? We fly down, I take the broom and try to find a log. Yeah, you're in control. All right. All right, so the two of you kind of-- make",a perception check.
Insight,"Thank you. Swamp shoes. So you can walk like me? Yes. I mean, not quickly, it won't help you walk quickly, it's not necessarily the most stealthy thing on earth, but you won't drop two feet into the muck every time you take a step. That's good. I've got a question. Can one of us that can turn into things go in the muck? Oh. Maybe. I feel like, is it bad? Do we get any kind of bad vibe, bad energy off the muck? Other than it being black magic?",MATT: Roll an insight check.
Athletics,"Did I say something? I don't know. No, you didn't say anything. Trees, you're so lovely, even though you're covered in this black stuff, I can tell that you have really good personalities. You've clearly been moisturizing. You really don't think that's-- All the branches begin to slowly sag down. Shit! I push off, we're flying, we're hovering. And you guys all begin to slide down-- I'm going to make a jump to another tree. Yeah, I do the same.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check, both of you."
Perception,"set it somewhere, just slapped out of their hand by a fist. Grog, what are you doing? This is our kitchen and we need to eat dinner here! I'm trying to activate these, and they require pain. (yells) With that, what was once a large black cauldron that was used in soup and other sort of base-like liquids, is now, pwang, a large heavy ding is now on the inside in the shape of a fist, and it's half as useful. Grog! Do I notice any difference in the gauntlets?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"missing for Grog to eventually whittle your triceratops hitpoints down to zero. However, in the process, you do manage to get a bit gored, suffering a total of nine points of piercing damage throughout the entirety of this, just little scrapes and scratches, the occasional puncture wound, but eventually you get one solid crack with the gauntlets across his face, and the triceratops form shifts back down to a tiny little Scanlan Shorthalt. Don't hit him, don't hit him! Wait, wait, did it work? Are your gauntlets better or whatever you're trying to do? Do I feel anything?",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"Okay. All right. We're about to take a rest. Eh. What else do you guys want to do? I'm gonna long rest now. Long rest, eat some chicken. Wait, do we have any vague plan, wait, we plan at dawn? We'll plan tomorrow morning. We'll plan at dawn. We'll plan at dawn. I wanna go upstairs and just open the door and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit and see what I see out the doorway.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Perception,"Oh, come on! Oh, um. That would be a 15. 15. All right. How much time do you spend out there? Well, at the door? Yeah. How much time can I spend and still get a good rest? Well, I mean, you need an eight-hour rest for a full night's rest, so it depends how much time you want to push off until you begin taking your rest. Oh, right. Well, how about a couple hours? Okay. First hour, seemingly no real change. Second hour,",go ahead and make another perception check.
Nature,"Well, I was staring at the door, and all of a sudden, around a space, about three trees just disappeared. Like something really large passed in front of it? No, like they dropped, and there's a hole in the canopy. Huh. That's different. That's interesting. Do you know of anything that would cause that? In the Feywild? Do I know of anything that would cause",that? Can I roll a nature check or something?

History,"I know that... Fenthras! No, that's all I wrote. (laughs) You were so excited for a second. So excited. I was so excited 'cause I saw it written down, but no, I didn't write. No. I'm sorry. You're gonna make me check my notes? I didn't write it down. Dammit. Balls. But I have a real good-- I know that there's a hatmaker named Deirdre somewhere in the world. Guys. You guys.",LIAM: Would a really successful history check help

I didn't write it down. Dammit. Balls. But I have a real good-- I know that there's a hatmaker named Deirdre somewhere in the world. Guys. You guys. Would a really successful history check help Vex remember what the fuck she was told?",MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and make a history check.
Stealth,"It's an old Druidish one? Yep. Thank you. All right. So. You guys emerge from the mansion? Yeah, anyone want to go stealth or anything? Yeah yeah yeah. It's just gonna be all of us presenting ourself? Maybe we'll go stealth... well, can a tree see us? I dunno. Let's go stealth. All right. Why not? And you guys can go talk to it. All right.",MATT: Roll stealth checks as you emerge from the
Perception,"tremor-sense. Oh, that's true. All right, all right, you're right. Don't do stealth, I'll present us all as a group. Okay. All right. You emerge. Still the dusklight, that kind of warm purplish-orange perpetual sunset glow in the sky. The tree there remains. You glance out. That little pocket where the trees were is filled once more. The trees now stand, the pocket is now done. That's where, that's where the hole was! But it's not a hole anymore!",MATT: Make a perception check as you're looking.
Athletics,"Can I run immediately underneath Sondur? Sondur, yes you can. Are there any vines that are hanging from him? There are none? There are vines hanging from the ceiling, but he himself just kind of sunk into the tree and then emerged above, he himself does not have any wayward vines that are just hanging. Right. Are there any vines that look like they might be thick enough for me to try and climb up if I wanted to get to his height? Probably a couple, yeah. Could I grab a few of those vines to try and climb up to where he's at?",MATT: Make an athletics check. With disadvantage.
Athletics,"Sic 'em. All right, that ends his turn, 20, Grog, you're up. I've been so taken out of this fight, it's driving me crazy. I'm hanging from vines, I see Wolfman come up, I'm not gonna be left out of this. Can I try and Tarzan my way over into the fray? Yes! Yes. This will be the majority of your movement and your action to do so. Just get me there, baby. All right. So you, go ahead and make an",athletics check.
Athletics,"Can I-- Just throw a fireball? I can't do that. Aren't you Johnny Storm? I gotta be there. Yeah, it's a melee thing. Do I still have any movement? No, just your action. To get through, I'd say... what's your speed as an elemental? 50. 50? It took you 25 to get there, you still have 25 feet, I would say. Can I start climbing 25 feet up the wall?",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Investigation,"So I was faking understanding the whole time, and then picked it up in retrospect listening to Laura's responses. I missed it. Yeah. Who's this Laura you're speaking of? (All laugh.) I don't know. I don't know anything. That's okay. It's fine that you didn't hear. He said nothing about a bloody dagger. Nothing at all. We should find that dagger. No question. Is there anything other than the bow worth looting on this terrible person, since I'm rummaging through his...",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Insight,"Yes, I could use a glass of wine. I could use a carafe of wine. Trinket licks the side of your face. Nuzzles you as you walk towards the castle. Wait, if you got a bow, and there were pixies, and you gave her something, did I get anything? Did I pick up any diseases? Lots of diseases. You fought bravely. And often. You wielded your weapon strongly and proudly, and had many definite physical encounters, and were never frozen. And showed your power and defended us to the best of your ability. You waded through blood, Grog.",TRAVIS: Can I insight check Scanlan?
Perception,"Are you guys exiting the castle now? Yes. Do it by hand? We might not have that much time. As you step out into the front open patio area, just outside of the castle's main gates, you look up and that faint blue shimmer that encases-- and you can now see it as a dome, and it comes down around, just directly around the city, closing at the very outskirts of the castle. You look in the distance as you see a few dark shapes growing larger and larger. They're coming this way! Hold.","MATT: I need you to make a perception check, all"
Insight,"Somebody has to be telling them things. Someone probably very high up. It could be Raishan taking the form of a human again, for all we know. Who was there and lived? Besides us? Jarett catches up, by the way. (panting) ""Is everyone all right?"" Yes. How are the citizens? Did you get everyone in there? ""Everyone seems to be safe and accounted for. There was a lot of fear, of course, but ""elation, whatever you did."" And he looks at you and looks at Shaun. ""Whatever you did, keep doing ""it, please.""",TRAVIS: I insight check Jarett.

Perception,"eyes. This time, you send out your consciousness once more. The druidic energies carry you an extended distance in but a few moments, and your vision clicks in and you see, perched against a snow-covered rock in the inside of a ravine, a shivering, small, green dragonling. Alone, and is partially asleep against the stone. You can see just past over this large, gaping ravine that is the center of this portion of Wildemount, you can see scattered rubble covered in ice and snow and small distant things you can't quite make out with your vision here occasionally moving through it. Can you see any trees? Do I find any trees?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"reach around and embrace your forms. You become more obscured the further the light is from your body. Keyleth, what are you doing? I cast Transport Via Plants on that big, fatty tree! Keyleth touches the edge of the tree, the rope which is affixed to above. The trunk (portal opens). Everyone ready? Go! I fly through stealthily. You fly through stealthily. I'm trying to get down to the ground quickly and hide behind something. Right. I would like all of you guys to make",stealth checks at disadvantage.
Acrobatics,"below eye-level. Vax and Keyleth? You guys just dart through, you holding her. Fly through, and then once I see them hit the ground, I'm going to dive-bomb us, and I'm going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll into the snow. All right. As you guys come falling out the side of the tree, you see nearby as a small, green tiny dragon gets startled and flies off. You guys go coasting, the wings expand for a second. It picks up and as you hit, whipping past the 15 feet of jagged rocks that were gathered at the base of the ravine, you scoot over it, the wings fold in around you, and you guys tumble into the",snow. Make an acrobatics check with disadvantage
Acrobatics,"slams shuts, the rope cuts at the other end as the portal closes. Percy, you just make it out as the rope gives way. It is now Grog and Percy plummeting toward the ground. I cast a Grasping Vine to grab Grog. You don't have the opportunity, because this all happens in a period of six seconds and you guys just landed and coasted in the snow. Am I right under Percy? He's about five feet ahead of you, yeah. (laughs) I'm going to let that happen. You're cushioning his fall? Yep.","MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just"
Perception,"13. As soon as you look over your shoulder and see the ground coming, you try and swing your legs underneath to catch you, to slide across. And you begin to. Your feet catch the rock and you feel the muscles tense. Your back gets jammed a little bit. And you catch Percy in your arms, but the momentum of Percy hitting you sends you back over, and you both tumble into the snow. You do prevent Percy from taking any damage, but you do suffer five points of fall damage. Stubbed your toe, big guy? I got a booby. Is Lockheed within range still? Can we see him?",MATT: You guys make a perception check.
Perception,"(croaking) Unless Tibs got further along with him, it was one word-- He was teaching him ""sit"" and ""play dead"" and stuff. One word at a time. All right. Stay. And stays and digs in the talons at the top of your leather armor shoulder, folds thed wings in and just waits there, huddled up against your shoulder for warmth.

Nature,"ravine. What you now look upon are all the fallen remains of each of these arcane islands now plummeted, crushed, and fell into the ravine and have been sundered and destroyed. You do see figures moving quickly and crawling over elements of it, and you see a cluster of them fighting over something and then disperse. How far off? They're probably a good 300 feet off.

Yep, because we're stupid!",MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Perception,"Common as we walk. Is everyone still cool with this? We're going to the chieftain. Just tell us when it's time to kill everybody. We improvise. It's what we do. I think this is actually going far better than I had hoped. Just remember Vex, ticking time bomb here. We've got to get in, get out. We've got one day here.

Not naturally forming, but essentially small natural bits of torchlight just pressed into the stonework to give some sort of a light source. You're led in for about five or so minutes. and you see other offshoot tunnels. It's like a giant anthill weaved throughout this, and you can see rudimentary furniture made of wood and stone, with limestone rock, whatever's available within the actual ravine here. Can I get a sense on when this was carved? If this was carved recently or if this has been here a while?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Persuasion,"for the time being. They say they come here ""because the Frigid Doom and other dragons who came are killing their people, as well. They have come ""to fight the dragon, or so they claim.

That's a name that raises your eyebrows. Everyone in Emon knows him. That's it. It's a lot of business transactions, but you can't really make out what or who.

Delweth, Dren, go with her and explore. All right. I check for traps.","LIAM: Okay, make a perception check."
Acrobatics,"No, I'm good. No, we're fine. How many feet away am I from the chest of death? 20. 20? They're on to us. What I want to do is run, take a flying leap off that first chest. Okay. Oh no. You can do that. And fly up, and do I have enough momentum to go over the chest that is holding her?","LIAM: Well, make an acrobatics check."
Insight,"Do you guys want to hear haikus? I'd love to hear a haiku. Do you have one ready for us? I killed all the chest...s. They are now all dead. So I am the best, y'all. So the room falls quiet, there are two slobbery disgusting messes with daggers and your shortsword is sticking out of it and you're surrounded by money. I race over to Devan. Good job, guys! That was really scary, I'm sorry about that, Tarvis. Are you all right? Oh, he cares?",LAURA: I insight check him. I know he's full of

Perception,"Oh. I don't think this is the one. No. How about we each get one of those nice, pretty stones, and then we don't reach in any more booty until we leave? How about that? You don't think the jewel's in any of these chests? It really would be smart to look. Sure. Let's search the chests. I'll search the room for the jewel. Check them for traps before you open them. Yeah. I'll check the barrels that I was standing on for traps.","LIAM: For traps? Okay, make a perception check."

In the interest of time, you all fan out, open everything you can find, drag your hand through chests full of wealth. There is a lot of money here. There is no giant emerald. I pocket as much as I can.",LIAM: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"You'll win it back. I go over and grab a ruby out of that box. I search for a ruby. Obviously? Yeah. You said we could all take one. I did. So I did. I'm taking a ruby. That big, I find one. Okay. Biggest one in the box. I move to the door. All right. Are we moving out? Yes. We're checking it for traps and seeing if it's locked.",LIAM: Make a perception check.

We're checking it for traps and seeing if it's locked. Make a perception check. Do you want me to Mage Hand the door? I grab my shortsword before all of this, also.

I was looking for the jewel before.",LIAM: Okay. Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah, I'll go to the doorway. Doorway then stairs up out of this basement. Yeah. So you're going up to the top of the stairs? Yeah. Polished wood. And from where you can see, you see a couple of dog beds. You don't see them all yet because you aren't that far into the room. Aside from the dog beds, it looks like a very beautiful room. Can I see any animal hair, or any saliva dried on the floor, any claw marks?",LIAM: Make a perception check.
Nature,"I will go and inspect the dog beds, is that what I've been commissioned to do? Yeah, take Delweth with you. I don't need her. One night, that's all, you know, after one night-- What am I doing? I'm checking the dog beds for traps. What did you roll? Five. You poke at them. They're soft, comfortable, warm, they smell mildly like pee. And I will sniff around and see if I can smell any animals.",LIAM: Make a nature check.
Insight,"Yes. What can we do for you, Tarvis? Delweth, will you secure the room, and see if there are any small dog doors that would open and surprise us in a very nasty way? Will you check the perimeter of the room? Dren and Devan, shall we make our way to that lovely desk? Yes! Sure. Your hesitation? I don't know why you want to check a desk. No? I mean, you're looking for an emerald, right? A big fat one?",MARY: I do an insight check.

Perception,"She gave you judgy face. Is that what I do? I want to insight check you. Me? Yeah. Okay. That would be a three. Do I add anything to it? Yeah, you add two. That would be a five. Make a roll and add your charisma bonus. I would have to roll, like, nothing, because-- ten. Great. Clobbered. Yeah, I don't know.",MARY: I'm going to do a perception check on the
Perception,"An almanac? I'll take the almanac. Do you remember your grandmother having any celestial connection? She's a wizard? She's a sorcerer. Just like me! Only stronger. Look, you guys want a jewel. Where is it? You have me here. I don't why you're not listening to me. It's going to be upstairs! You stuck your hand in the thing and we had to fight that. Yeah, but those weren't there before, you know? Can I check the underside of the desk and the chair for hidden switches?","LIAM: Yes, make a perception check."
Perception,"What language is it, Tarvis? What languages do you speak? Common and Orc. Elvish and Dwarven. Fuck. The globe is a planet globe, or is it an orb? It's a planet globe, and you can't read what's on that, either. You spin it around, look at it for a while, you do recognize the coast of Emon. If I open up the almanac and flip through the pages really fast, are there any markings or things that are circled, or anything that might be a cypher or codex for the letters? No.",ASHLY: Has anyone done a perception check on the
Perception,"first floor. There's other rooms in the house  there's a kitchen, dining room, library, and sitting room for guests. Out at the front of the house are where the twin sets of staircases are that lead up to the second floor, to your old bedroom, and to the hall. The hall. The room. Can I lead them there? Are you going to go on a little march? Should we? Do you trust me? No. Do you want a jewel? Yeah. Let's go to the doors. I inspect the doors to see if there any traps and go stealth.",LIAM: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"I don't hear any dogs, no. Is this the hallway you were talking about? No. This is a hall, though. That's true! Should we walk down it? I'll go in the lead this time. Again with my rapier out. Is that all right with you, Tarvis, if I take the lead in this? Please, yes. Do you want me to send some lights down the hallway? Not right now. I will take the rear. I do not like dogs. So you guys slowly creep your way down.",Everybody make a stealth check.
Perception,"14. 24. 19. You quietly move your way down, this one bumps a potted plant on the way-- Is that dog? Everybody holds still for a second. Nothing. You continue on, you eventually meet another set of doors, just like the ones you went through. You know this leads to the front of the house. What's through there? The foyer. Again, I'll take Mage Hand and go along the edge of the door, checking for traps--",LIAM: Make a perception check.
Perception,"the rest of the city, out of her grounds. You can barely, in this heavy rain, see two more guys, standing on the other side. Be quick about it. Search, come back, and let's move on. So you guys split off to the library? Yes. You can see in here. It's totally dark, but bookshelves curve all the way around the entirety of this room. There's one of those rolling ladders that slides along to reach the books on the top shelf. There's a nice loveseat with a small side table next to it. There's a book, open, upside down, on the table.",SAM: I'll do a perception check to see if there is
Perception,"(laughter) We take the last tarp and pull it off. It is another love seat like the one that you saw down in the library. It's identical, actually. I take a dagger out and shove it in the cushions of the love seat and drag it across, open it up. Stuffing pops out. No need for violence. Those dogs get all over the place and ruin shit all the time. Dogs? What dogs? I know every child's got a secret hiding",place in their room. So I want to perception check
Stealth,"I don't know if you can control yourself in the funroom, so I'm going to take the rope that I have, and I'm going to bind your hands behind your back before we go into the funroom. Oh, that's pointless because I'm going to need my hands. If you want to get through the funroom, I'm going to need my hands! I can watch her, Tarvis. I'll make sure she doesn't do anything-- Oh, Dren, you said you wanted to tie her hands behind her back for me? Yeah, Tarvis, that's what I said, sure. And I tie it, but really loose, but they don't see that, maybe?",LIAM: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"Well, yeah! Where was the wall sconce? It was right there. I feel right where she's pointing. You give a knock. Maybe we need her blood. Dren, cut her. No, there's more to do! Sheesh! Can I walk down the hallway? You can, yeah. Look, if there's traps, then she'll get hit by them! Is that what you're doing? Can I look for traps as I'm walking down the hall?","LIAM: Sure, make a perception check."
Perception,"down the hallway? You can, yeah. Look, if there's traps, then she'll get hit by them! Is that what you're doing? Can I look for traps as I'm walking down the hall? Sure, make a perception check. Where were the shields? Were they at the bottom of the hallway from where we are? No, they were hanging up on the sides of the doors decoratively. That we came in? Yeah, the ones you came in.",ASHLY: I also make a perception check.
Investigation,"Sure, make a perception check. Where were the shields? Were they at the bottom of the hallway from where we are? No, they were hanging up on the sides of the doors decoratively.

I'm going to check the shield to see if I can intuit how it works.",LIAM: Investigation check.
Arcana,"sort of arcane scrawl on the floor. Like, scrawl? Yeah, like a ring written in a circle. You tug the rug back a bit and you see it goes further under the carpet and you see the edge of a spiral pattern of writing that you can't-- Is it Elvish? I was going to ask. It's not. Oh, it's not? No. Dwarvish? No. Orcish?",LIAM: Make an arcana check.
Perception,"It's not. Oh, it's not? No. Dwarvish? No. Orcish? Make an arcana check. Oh, me? No problem. That's a motherfucking one. (laughter) That is Esperanto. Cool. I can jump on things and unlock things. All right, we will start walking very",slowly. Can I do a perception check for any traps

Perception,"Devan's first. I'm third, Dren's fourth. There's also enough room to go side by side, which is-- No, I know, but I'm pushing her forward. Everyone going single-file, yeah? Who's third? I am. And Obby in the rear, like he likes it. So you continue to walk? Slowly, investigating everything as we go. Are you looking for traps, further traps? I use my Mage Hand to push the carpet as we go forward to see if there's anything--","LIAM: Sure, but also make a perception check. This"
Perception,"One was a lake. Do we see her splashing around in the painting? 45 seconds have passed. I go to the water painting and start feeling it. What's your constitution modifier, Laura? Plus six. I go and splash around in the water. Does anything happen? What water? There's no water. Isn't there water? Oh, in the painting. I'm looking at the painting to see if there's anything.","LIAM: Okay, make a perception check."

Perception,"didn't know that was going to happen? You've actually never been in this room. I've never been in this room. You were in the hallway, though, before. Yeah. And I told you guys to look for a wall sconce, and then you marched me down the hallway. Let's do it again. Yeah. All right. Anything else in this room? In this room? Yeah. Have a look around if you'd like. I'd like to look around the room.","LIAM: Perception check, please."

Insight,"air to create shards of ice and use them. Yep. Sounds like a pretty special woman. I think you should be grateful to have a grandmother like her. (laughs) I think she would like you a lot. Family is very important. So what do we do? I don't know. There's another rat over there. What's in this room? What's in the center of the room? What is it? That circular, beautiful, spiraling outward, floral thing? I don't know. You never used it?",TRAVIS: I'd like to insight check her. Does she
Perception,"you choose-- It's everybody within a 20-foot area. Everybody, or-- Everybody. I can't be specific as to who, what, and the where now? Big ass slumber party. What are you casting? Sleep, I was going to cast Sleep. Now, you can slap whoever you want awake afterwards. But it's a 20-foot area. You can also aim it straight up in the air. I can. All right, I'm going to aim it straight up at that thing. I don't know what that",is. I can't do a perception check on what the fuck

Sleight of Hand,"I don't have everybody. Devan, what did you roll? Three. Dren, go. Should I smash the emerald? Everybody can tell, everybody's moving, you see everybody moving at the same time. What are you going to do? Tied together in a glorious love-- beautiful moment. I'm going to move in front of Devan. Wait. Why are we seated at these tables? (laughter) It's all clear now. And while I'm moving, can I give her the emerald?",LIAM: Make a sleight of hand check.
Perception,"You can, sure. That'll be your whole action and move if you want. You can do a perception check if you want, though. My perception is bunk. There's no sweeping attacks I can do, I'm assuming. I can't do a crazy flourish? No. You can disengage to get away out of that little kill box, and then I'd let you do perception if you want. That sounds smart. Yeah, I'm going to move out of the kill box. Disengage. I guess next to Devan. Here? Sure. And then I'll do a perception.","LIAM: Perception check, roll."
Perception,"finger pipes? Yes. Can I try and play some music on that shit? You can. I had the baby finger pipes on my body. They're not there. They're not there? Oh, then I go and Dren-- oh, she doesn't have them. Oh, look, they're on Devan's stupid dead body. Can I try and play some music? (raspberry sound) We're going to die in here. What else is in that room?",LIAM: You're going to do a perception check?
Persuasion,"I see this going on, and I stand up on something, and I yell to the students-- Before this happens, as you're getting up, you watch as Vax rears back, and as he throws it, (yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground, and you're like (pained noises). Seriously? I jump up on a chair and I yell to the Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill! You are to attack that man right there, that large man, as a test of your strength and training. Now! Don't kill them, Grog!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"your strength modifier? Seven. Seven. You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half because you're taking Uncanny Dodge. So only seven points bludgeoning damage. You stay there for a second, stunned. You feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat. And in the distance you hear: (strained) I feel so alive. (laughter) First rule of Fight Club. Can I check the Titanstone Knuckles? Have they changed now that I've kicked a friend in the face?",MATT: (laughing) Make an investigation check.
Insight,"slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy, now restored to its full strength. He's got to use the privy at some point. Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's okay. A moment passes before the door opens again and you see Gilmore there, beads of sweat down the front of his face. He's got his fuzzy purple-blue robe wrapped around him. ""My sincerest apologies, ""I had to take care of the now morning ritual."" How are you holding up, Gilmore? ""I'm fine. This is child's play compared to what you're having to deal with on a daily basis, ""I'm sure.""",MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?
Investigation,"Can I reach them? Yeah. Pull them out. Really nice, high-quality silk and cotton based, embroidered shirts. Look more ceremonial, special event type, long, maybe knee-length. What's the decoration like in the room? Currently, it's pretty bland. You can see a couple of colored tapestries similar to the center of the floor rug that are hanging, but there are a lot of blank areas. It looks like decorations have been removed, or at least haven't been there for a long time. The room, for the most part, seems to be abandoned. Is the box trapped?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"this small oasis town, he goes, ""Let's see, if you follow-- that is the sun."" He looks up, and you see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky. ""The sun is there. It will be setting... that direction. ""Continue... what is the word you speak?"" North, northwest. No, northeast. ""That is west. You want to north, so go that way. Yes. That is where you want to go."" Thank you. Is there a road to follow, or is it just a direction? ""I haven't been in many years. As far as I know, there are signs. There are not roads. There ""are guides you could hire to bring you there.""",MARISHA: Can I do like a nature check or take note
Deception,"here, before I do this? It's a one-camel town. I mist us. All right. As you guys take a moment to concentrate, each one of you transforms into mist. As you begin to go one by the other, you do hear a couple of (gasps). You glance over your shoulder to see three kids, all looking up at you all with these big, scared smiles. Before I go, I say: stay in school, kids. And then I mist. I'm going to Slimer the kid. As I turn into mist, I go: I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"the night? They're maybe 40 feet from the gates. Well, let's camp 40 feet. Let's camp with them. You want to put a magical door 40 feet? I'm perfectly okay. It's not like they can come in. No one can enter who can't be invited. You want to make a mystical door floating in the middle of their tents? Do the people seem friendly? Do they seem tired? We're going to camp next to their campsite.",MATT: Make a perception check
Persuasion,"Great. So with that, Percival, Scanlan, and Vex wait outside the shimmering doorway to Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You see the guards begin to approach. The one at the front, a square-jawed, intense-looking man who looks to be not enjoying his current time schedule as a guard on the outside of the southern gates of Ank'Harel approaches, hand at the side clutching some sort of weapon that he has currently sheathed. ""May I ask the business of this strange conjuration ""you've brought at this hour of the night?"" It is our very expensive tent. Be pleased.","MATT: Make a persuasion check, Percy."
Stealth,"See you in a minute! [break] Welcome back, everyone! Returning from the break, Vox Machina has an evening of rest in Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You come to consciousness the following morning, stationed within the beautiful confines of this magical mansion, unaware directly of what awaits you on the other side of the doorway. However, the morning is yours. What do you wish to do? I'm going to stealth back to my room. Okay. (laughs) Oh. No one sees anything.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Persuasion,"We are seeking a man called... J'mon Sa Ord. No, I don't think we want to talk to the king. Do we? Merchant warrior? No, not that one? Who the fuck are we trying to see? We would like to talk to J'mon Sa Ord or his or her advisors to seek advice. ""You come for an audience with the emperor?"" We come for an audience with many people, to be honest. We are looking at many avenues of possible help. Contacts, trade, anything that can help us in our time of dire need.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"find and come across. If you wish, you could ""purchase this batch."" Okay. I've seen this before. I'm not interested in buying from you. I just want a market or a bazaar or anything. ""Bazaar. You are looking for the Suncut Bazaar?"" Yeah, that! ""It is farther down that way. Look to the blue tower in the center of the city? Walk in its ""direction to the eastern skyline--"" I'm not looking in the direction. I'm keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's talking.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street. I need a new reed for that. And here you are, amongst the Suncut Bazaar. Can I whip around and see if anyone's following us? Ooh, Dust of Tracelessness.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"stare intently. They're more curious, but no one appears to be following you. Are the shops here indoors, or are they outdoor tent markets? There are a few that appear to go into buildings, but the majority of this, as you look at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up stand-ups, and even the center of the street, blankets set out, with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting for anybody to come and approach. Do we see any spice merchants?",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Shubad? ""Shubad."" Keyleth. ""A pleasure to meet you."" A pleasure. Thank you so much. Are any of the barkers talking about magic stuff? I'm also looking for a soothsayer. What do you want to see, a show? Well, I don't know. It just seems so exotic. Anything out of the ordinary and/or a soothsayer, card-reader, bones-reader, whatever they have that's like that.",MATT: Okay. Both of you make investigation checks
Investigation,"I gave away my salt-lick rock! You did. (laughter) I take a moment to marvel at how a being of such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at the same time. It's amazing. I'm going to plant myself at the end of two rows of the intersection and wait for people to Spice? Spice, spice, spice? You spice it? Spice, spice, spice? Can I have seen Percy looking around? Yeah. Can I help him look? Percival, what did you roll?",TALIESIN: Where did it go? Investigation? I rolled
Deception,"shoes, and before him a deck of cards that is laying in a stack, and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees. It sounds like fun. Want to walk up? Yeah? You mind blowing a little bit of money on this? No, actually. Are we all there? Depends on if you guys want to follow. I'd like to follow. Okay. as you guys are approaching, you over in the corner. Spice it? Spice it? Fusaka!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Insight,"What did you say? Oh, we search for a man. Pulls up two more cards and throws them, and they land almost exactly in the same place as the other two cards that he tossed before. They scoot to a stop. One card appears to be mostly blank, except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol or letter that you don't recognize. And the other one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a pile of coin. ""You seek this man, yet it is not a ""man you seek. To where the luck brings you, the answers lie."" And he puts out his hand. Five more. Five more. ""And the third question?""",LAURA: Can I insight check him as he's reading the

""How much do you want?"" Oh my god. I'm not prepared for this! He starts looking a little untrusting. Be cool, man. Be cool. Enough to get me through a week of heavy use. I want to go on a bender.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"Thanks, mom. It is burned into my head. Getting our own? Yeah, we go get our own. You guys are brought into one of the small sections of the Shade. You are given your choice of various tobaccos. While it's not a large room, per se, you can all comfortably lounge in there. It's a nice place to get away. You can hear the distant sounds of the city, but for the most part, there's a soft violin music that plays towards the center of the area, so at least it has a nice atmosphere to it. As we're in there, do we notice anyone with any large scars walking around?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Is that where we're going to sleep tonight? That's where the Scarbearers are. We can get a room here. And your deal is this evening, yes? Yeah, we've got some time for that. So we take off for the Debt's Respite. Okay. Who's leading the charge for that? No, you're not. I will. Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check, if you don't mind. Investigation. You're terrible at those. (laughing) This is everything I wanted. I'm so happy right now. 26.",MATT: 26 investigation check. Within ten minutes
Perception,"partially ajar and as you push it open, you can see the inside is a whole different story. As your eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a bustling business of barhands slinging tankards across seven stained wood tables, some of the folk look rather day-drunk, similar to these individuals, though it has worn a bit off since the original sip. And most look to be various miscreants or post-work farmers taking a break. The interior is familiar and probably closer to the taverns you're used to in more of the poorer districts of Emon and surrounding cities than some of the more luxurious areas you've recently found yourselves in. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth-- actually,","Keyleth, make a perception check with"
Investigation,"""All right. I take no responsibility what happens to your bear outside."" Thank you. ""That'll run you ten gold per room. 30 gold for the night."" (whispers) Ten gold? (louder) Are these really fancy rooms, then? ""No. God no. I don't know where you're from in Emon or what the prices are there, but here, ""it's expensive."" Every fucking thing is expensive here. Can I attempt to start looking around the room to try and find anything interesting and try and be useful?",MATT: Make an investigation check with
Perception,"it's up to her when she wants to respond."" Is there anything else you can tell me about her? He starts giving you a curious look and goes, ""You come in here asking to hire one of my ""finest and don't know what work she does?"" I know what work she does. ""What work do you need her for?"" We need to save the world. ""And you need her help to save the world."" Sadly, but true. We at the very least need her blessing. While he's talking, can I keep an eye on the figure in the corner?",MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Perception,"walks towards the table. Holds up the scroll, and the figure leans in. Covers his mouth and he whispers into the ear of the figure. The figure takes the scroll, gives a nod to all of you, and walks out of the tavern. ""He'll deliver that to her ""promptly, now be on your way. 15 gold."" Oh yes, of course! Thank you for the rooms. Takes a keyring out and starts fudging through the keys, pulls a few off and tosses them to you across the table. ""All right, you've got it for a night."" I heard Grog. I'm going to follow out the door, go stealth. Okay. You vanish out the door. Make a",perception check.
Perception,"can see the figure, full on, arms out to the side rushed behind, going into a very fast run, down the shaded hallway. Shaded hallway? The alleyway. I'll follow. Okay, so you continue to follow. At a distance. All right. Following the masked figure, you continue to give chance. It darts erratically, zig-zagging between areas. You can see this is a very trained pattern to lose anybody following them, but you're also trained in following those that wish not to be followed. Make another",perception check.
Perception,"You come around one corner, and you can see there's a wall that ends there, and you see just a little slip of material pass. And as you glance over, you can see the figure has jumped down onto a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed sector of this part of Ank'Harel, and has already darted beneath a nearby bridge and overpass that walks across to another series of buildings. You leap over, keeping in the shadow, and give chase down that way. You turn around underneath the bridge and you can see underneath the bridge, there is an archway that leads into a dark path down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you. Make another",perception check.
Stealth,"sunlight is coming through. You can just see the dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again, down the right past that exit. You follow, and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a storage section outside of a warehouse. It ducks behind another one. Darts up to a building that looks to be shuttered and closed. It looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that says, ""A Kingly Home."" It moves an empty rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel, dropping it inside the building, slides the barrel over it again. Looks back and forth.",Make another stealth check.
Insight,"Yeah! ""Then I guess you know what an animal's bum tastes like, eh?"" (sputters) Hold on. You mean they squeeze the asshole of something out there? ""Oh, completely!"" No! ""They hold it down and just squeeze its abdomen and the whole sandkheg spews out into this little ""glass barrel and then you pay for it. Top dollar."" Yeah, it's 300 something gold! ""Oh, did you buy some?"" No.",MATT: Make an insight check.
Investigation,"Thank you for the rooms. Breakfast? Is there breakfast here? (scoffs) ""No, you find your own food."" Awesome. Does he still have some drink in front of him? It hasn't been filled since, no. Oh, never mind. Do you guys head to your rooms? Okay. You make your way up to the rooms. They're all clean, serviceable, nothing too fancy, but functional rooms. Each with two beds. I want to check for anything unusual, if there's anything iffy about the rooms.",MATT: Investigation check.

Investigation,"there's anything iffy about the rooms. Investigation check. Oh, I would follow suit. Investigation check. Oh, for the love of fucking-- Natural one? No. Nine. Nine. Nothing seems to be out of place or out of the ordinary. Obviously. 13. 13? Seems to be a room. I'm just going to check under the beds, that's it.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"weapons? You walk around. and there are weapons being sold. Are there any exotic weapons? No. Most weapons you find here are ornamental  they're for decoration. They're for putting above mantelpieces. There are various blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back where you can easily mount them to a wall. None of them, that you can see, at least, that are open in this bazaar for sale, are presented as an actual item for warfare. Okay. Is there a magic shop?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Persuasion,"""For the belt, maybe."" For the belt, obviously. We've already established that that's in the silver range and certainly not touching the gold. ""Right, but you're willing to have and to offer that 75 gold for it, please."" 75 gold for the entire set. ""No, it's not going to work. I'm sorry."" No, and of course that makes sense that a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair. I'm starting to take a nap against a column standing up. Just buy it. 100 gold. You've had it for so long.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. ""Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask ""your business here."" Forgive us for our intrusion. We come seeking an audience of J'mon Sa Ord. ""Our emperor does not take meetings. My apologies, but I must ask you to leave."" We are, in fact, a group of ambassadors from the continent of Emon, from the cities of-- Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It concerns the fate of the world.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"""that for a time."" It looks that way, but I also have a strapping-sized bladder, and I've been known to leave strapping-sized messes in corners. You see, I don't really come from all this finery, so the side of the wall is just as good with me. It's just I'm trying to be polite. She leans behind the hallway. (foreign language) ""Just a moment."" Another guard walks up behind and kicks a bucket into the room. That'll do. Put up or shut up. Can I hear anything from the other side of the door?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"giant bastard? You may! What is the range on it? 120 feet, on the Chain of Returning. Yes. No. Is that right? No, that's not right. I thought it was 30, it's a pretty short distance to throw it. Oh shit, is it? I don't have it! It's like a thousand feet. We're a little rusty. How tall would you say this guy is? This guy? 15 feet. He's 15 feet tall, Grog. 15 feet. Uh-huh. Chain of Returning! It doesn't say! It must be attached. Melee weapon. Thrown.",Bonus action: athletics strength check provided to
Stealth,"bonus action to go earth elemental! As the growling sound of stone and metal seems to vibrate the floor, you step back and hulk out into your elemental form, almost returning a similar earth-against-stone growl back at it. There she is. Top of the round. Vax, you're up. Would you allow me to use my bonus action to go stealth and quietly run over using my hasted speed to get over to my sister behind that stone thingy in the middle of the room? You could certainly try. Yes, I'd like to try. Four, five, six. one. Get behind there, go",ahead and roll a stealth check.
Athletics,"begin to swell in size, your strides getting longer and longer. By the time you approach it, you are right there. You are now one size category larger. Mighty Joe Young, bitch. Push him out the window, Grog! All righty, so you are attempting to make a shove attack. Okay. You push it away from you. Yes, a strength check against either his strength or dexterity, it's the target's choice. He also has disadvantage on strength checks. So he's going to choose dexterity. Nope, his dexterity is fucking awful. So you",go ahead and make an athletics check.
Athletics,"Why would you throw that out there?! Great way to hear God laugh is to announce your plans. Point! Grog, your turn. After seeing Vex fall and then Scanlan lift her up and then Vax get slammed into the wall and Keyleth showing up in this very attractive form, I would like to reckless attack, and for a bonus action, go into a frenzied rage for a third attack, and use all three to try and push him out the window. Yes! All righty! You go into your frenzied rage.",Go ahead and make three athletics checks. First one.
Athletics,"Ank'Harel! Do we notice any rocket boosters on its heels? You have plenty of movement. You push it back, you move in to get within range there. Go ahead and make another. 27. 27, that is a 17. Yes! Pushed back, it's right up to the edge now, its shoulders dropped against the edge. Its blade is still on the ground. Do you move in and go for a final one? Yes, please.",MATT: Make an athletics check one more time.
Athletics,"Grog kicks it out the window and it disappears out of sight. I find earth elemental Keyleth. (heavy hand slap) Don't leave me hanging, says Bigby's Hand! Yeah! Whack! It's like a jive hand shake, it's like, yeah! Get a little weasel. I'm going to skitter over to my sister and help her up Saving Private Ryan style. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself there. Go for it. At 3rd-level there. Hey Grog! Chest bump! Huh! Yeah!",MATT: Both of you guys make athletics checks.

Investigation,"Percy, point me in the direction. I'll fly and get it. Natural 20. You became the animated gif of the cat that gets the flower on its head and sees through space and time. You guys watch as Percy zones out for five minutes, the hand moving at a rapid pace across the paper. I found a window and I'm doing the Beautiful Mind. What that enables you, as you get some ideas as to the trajectory, the speed, the strength of Grog in the non-grown form versus the grown form. This does allow you, whoever wants to lead this","expedition, one investigation check to possibly"
Perception,"So we're not going to hit them. Excuse me, but this is poetic justice if I have ever seen it. That is beautiful. This has been the metaphor game. This is a metaphor for our entire existence. Yeah, some poor folks in Ank'Harel right now are having a really bad afternoon. Yeah, I do a Gust cantrip overtop of us to keep from getting splattered. I'm going to keep my hand on your wrist, Percy. I'm not going to look down. I'm going to look ahead. I'm good. He directs you vaguely where it may have",landed. I need you to make a perception check.
Persuasion,"""This is my surprised face. This is Quan a Drensal, or The Run of Luck. It is a traditional ""old Marquet game of chance. It's what the casino is partially named after.

I'd say at this point, because you're no longer hiding in a corner, you're actually entering a social place, you'll have to go ahead",and roll another stealth check.
Persuasion,"after the other, onto the table. They are tied at the very top. It's a high-quality burlap-type material on the outside, only the weave is much tighter so it's not liable to leak or stumble out. ""So it is difficult to acquire this. I would say one for 250, or both for 400 gold."" How do I know it's of a quality I'm accustomed to, from my homeland? ""Because I have a reputation to uphold.

Deception,"For the cost of two gold pieces amongst the three of you, or four of you, if you're a part of this as well, Grog-- The slushy margaritas. No, I'm hitting on ladies. Yeah! With a simple shoulder tap and an introduction, they turn with a smile and stare directly into the rhino-like helmet on your forehead, seem confused, and lose interest very quickly.

Intimidation,"And he goes, (chuckles) ""What, this one?"" Yes, yes, I am the magister of Sh'breeze, and I have many steeds. A night with me would truly honor your lady fair.

Maybe I can package it into smaller amounts and sell it on the street to recoup some of the money. Do we have an afternoon to kill? Are you talking to yourself? Yes. Damn it, what did I do? I should have","insight checked him, or I could've dominated,"

Yeah, they're snobby. Thank you. ""My pleasure."" Be back in a bit. Meep-meep. I'll lead the charge.",MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"buildings are very nice. They look constructed in a type of architecture that's more reminiscent of Tal'Dorei or other civilizations than you've seen most of Ank'Harel's construction, so you figure these buildings are probably newer or at least this district seems to have a little different cultural flavor to it than the rest of the city. To the southern side of it you do see a large multi-tiered structure that is made of a smoky quartz mixed with white marble in places. This, with an immediate glance, you'd probably gather is the Crystal Chateau. Does the opalescent stone have any similarity to the stones of Whitestone?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"from this distance. And it looks excavated, and not just like something opened up and then they kept digging? Correct. You can see there is actually a pattern to the carving of the earth. It looks like it's been carved in, layer after layer after layer, much like a small-scale strip mine. Do the stones look like they broke the ground, or does it look like the stones were actually built around this? Has this been here since the construction of this area? Or does it seem like perhaps in the last 20 years or such, they've just gone down?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Insight,"Pops back out about ten minutes later. Darts over to the edge. ""My apologies for keeping you ""waiting. The headmaster is unable to see visitors at the moment."" Oh no. Why? ""Perhaps try next week."" Oh no, that's such a long time. We have a very short amount of time  we're on a crunch. Yes, is there a standby list we can get on?

Insight,"pull out a piece of the green elemental shard from Whitestone and show it to him. ""Might I have a look at that?"" He takes it, reaches into his robes, pulls out a very well-crafted glass jeweler's piece, glances over it for a second. He clicks a small button on the side of it. Each time he does, you see the lens change color on the end of it. ""I have not seen ""anything like this. Not of condensed, purified whitestone."" Yes. I take it back.

Stealth,"beneath buildings, to small side roads, until eventually you find your way into this small area that's nestled in between two large warehouses. There appears to be some crates. There's some barrels around this small building that reads, on the sign above the door, A Kingly Home. The door is closed. There appears to be a window right next to the door. There is the series of barrels, and there's the one barrel you saw where the individual moved it and placed the actual request that you guys made through a small slot in the wall. Are there any other people around? You can see-- actually, everyone roll a","stealth check, who's coming through. Yeah, you"
Perception,"Okay. You guys make your way through the hallway. As you turn the corner, there is one person turning around the corner the opposite direction, who's carrying a bundle of various large, nut-like fruits. He turns and bumps into you and almost drops it and catches it, ""Be more ""careful,"" then just continues walking past. You guys look into the main area where the home is, and it's right there before you. Other than that person who just passed by, it's pretty quiet here. This part of the city doesn't see a lot of foot traffic, which is probably why it makes for a nice home for an individual that does shady work. And nobody's hiding?",MATT: You can make a perception check.
Investigation,"for a little bit and look. What about the little thing where the note got slipped in? I don't know anything about that. You guys watch the dragonfly (tink) Do I see anyone in any of the windows? It's dark inside. The drapes are drawn except for a little bit of a sliver where the light would get through. You see a little peek of a wooden floor, but there's no light from the inside. Okay. Just going to go all the way around the house, high and low, looking for a way in. Do I find it?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Make an investigation check. A lot. 24. 24. After coming around, you begin to slink around by the barrels and you can see, in the stonework that has been built, the masonry that forms the exterior of the building, there appears to be a very small hole, about cork-size, hidden behind one of the barrels in the front. There's just enough space between the wall where you can barely squeeze in and poke through. It's big enough where your wings will hit, so you have to attach to it and crawl through before coming out the other side. As you come out the other side, you're now inside the house. Dark interior. Make a",perception check.
Perception,"light is bouncing off the sunbeam. You can see, beneath the opening where you came in, the rolled-up scroll, that was placed inside the small case that held your guys' message, is still resting right beneath the opening, untouched. Wow, they haven't even opened it? Assholes. Maybe she hasn't been home. Am I in a room that's closed off? Can I keep going through the house? Yeah, you can keep going through the house. There's a big part of the house you haven't explored yet. All right, I'll see if I can make my way.",MATT: Make another perception check.
Investigation,"us. Oh, we left them way behind. Do we have time to go get more slushy beverages? No, Keyleth. No. You work on the lock. I'm going to go get the rest. I'm going to head back. So Vax, you head back. You get the rest of the party. Vex? Do I see anyone around? You actually see a couple folks walk by. You take Scanlan and you guys step into the shadows. You wait a minute for them to just pass by, and as soon as they're out of earshot, you head back. Can I check for traps?",MATT: You may. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"increase, though. I try it again. Natural 20! Very difficult because it is not only a difficult lock, with the interior padlock, but Scanlan broke off pieces of wire in it that are in danger of permanently breaking the lock and making it unusable. You, however, thankfully manage to maneuver the tools to remove the pieces of wayward wire, finish the lock, and as soon as you finish unlocking the padlock on the inside with a curved piece, the door opens, and there's a slight flash. Nothing. Oh no. It's an alarm. We need to get the fuck out of here.",MATT: No noise. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Oh shit. So the trap could've done something to somebody before? No, more blood toward the trapdoor and then it fades, so someone came out of the trapdoor-- And tried to haul ass out. What was the flash? An alarm. Do I see footprints around? As you get close and look down, you can see, in a couple of the dried blood smears, there appear to be footprints in them that are heading out. I go over to the trapdoor and inspect it for traps.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"The trapdoor is still open. It's left open and the stairs that descend. There is no trap in the vicinity. Looks like it's been untouched for a while. You guys are just now starting to approach the outside of the house. As you get there, you see the door is partially ajar, and it is open, and you can vaguely see movement on the inside of Vex and Scanlan looking about. Nice job, ace. What's going on? There was a trap. I think there was a trap on it and I didn't know. But I looked for traps! There was a flash. Does that sound familiar? Is anyone new on the streets or on the roofs above us?",MATT: Perception check.
Investigation,"of it. Does it look like it was trying to open the door? Does it look like it got the door open, or it was stuck inside? No, it looks like, as it wraps around the top, it looks like somebody had lifted it up. Oh, the trapdoor. Is there blood on the handle? Is there blood on the door itself? Looking at the inside handle, there are very faint traces of dried blood. Can I do a check on the outside threshold of the door to see if I can see the blood go outward?","MATT: Sure, make an investigation check."
Perception,"Okay, but there could still be. Okay, investigation, right? 19. Does not appear to be trapped. So I'm still stealthed? I'm going to gently open the door and peer in. You pull it open, look inside. This is a larger chamber with a much better set of furniture. It looks like the woman that you had hired probably lived here more than above. You see what would be weapons racks, but have been cleaned out. You see a couple of lanterns that are placed upon a table in the corner that have since burned out. One of them has actually fallen over, and it appears the glass is broken on the ground. Make a",perception check.

You, inspecting the body, the puncture wounds that are in the front have corresponding puncture wounds in the back as well. You can see clasps on the shoulders where a cloak would be affixed, but the clasps have been broken off and there is no cloak there. Any treasures in the room?",MATT: What'd you roll for an investigation check?
Investigation,"But how'd they get out without-- so whoever the murderer is set the trap as he/she was leaving. The murderer who's shooting bullets. Is there anything gained by discussing this here? Do we need to look any further, or should we get the hell out? One last quick glance around the room to see if there's anything helpful. Percy, can I see your gun? I hand it to her without even thinking about it. I inspect-- (gasps) You're a genius.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"than outside. Secret passage? Yeah, it's this way. I think I checked for traps last-- Because you already went up to the top. Yeah. I went all the way to the top and peeked around. Yeah, there were no traps and you managed to make it through below the small-- I had a look around. Is it public, or off to the side? It's a small alley that leads into an open public space, so as long as you listen out for anybody in the vicinity, you can-- I'm going to scurry up, open up--","MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check."
Survival,"a grate that's pushed there, you push it open, and the metal circle plops on the side. You find that there's actually a piece of thin cloth that's covering it as you push it over, and you listen up for a second. You hear the bustle on the outside of the city, but you do not notice anyone paying attention to it, and you use the right moment to dart up and you begin taking watch for the rest of the party. I'm off to the side like Marion in Raiders, to the side of the alley. Before I leave the room, can I check to see if it seems like Ripley was alone or if there were other people?",MATT: Make a survival check.
History,"An island of glass trees. An island of grass. Ah, boy. Island of glass? Yeah, which doesn't sound promising, to be totally honest. So we might have to mist there. How far away is-- It's continents, it would take weeks. Don't they have an airship here? Wait, the Water Ashari are in the Ozmit? They're in the Ozmit Sea, yes. Do I know if they would be close by this island of glass? I'm going to go ahead and have... let's see.","Scanlan, roll a history check? And if you could"

""How do you know where she lived?"" We are very clever. But not clever enough to stop this. This appears to have happened possibly before we even-- we don't know when it happened.

The bell seemed to have notified whatever crew is bringing the platform up, but he didn't get a chance to finish bringing his load off the platform before you rung the bell.

As you leave the two gentlemen below, as the two of you lift up on this platform, you make your way up to the elevated terrace that marks the actual skyport and it's a large, wide, thick platform that's built atop a series of warehouses that fill out this district, and this was a newer addition to it as this technology became",available.

Yeah, you take a listen. Doesn't appear to be any sound from the other side. Damn it.

Investigation,"(whoosh) Inside the office. Thankfully you have your gnomish dark vision. It is dark in here, there are no lights. The table and chairs and the general decor of the room seemingly untouched since last time you were in here. All right. Is there any source of light around here? There are a couple of lanterns in the corner that could be lit. I will light one. All right. (whoosh) You turn the lantern up. Light glows. Going right into the desk, looking for anything. Keys, gold, contraband, weapons.",MATT: Investigation check.

You get the sense this isn't a stationary room that they use as a base of operations, it's almost like a rental space used when people want to come in here and do business. Which happens often in a casino establishment. They want to make sure that they provide their clientele with all the necessary needs, and a lot of the rooms on this center floor are to facilitate the meetings between the top and the bottom. Damn it. All right, I'll do one more",investigation check to see if there's any hidden

But who knows who knows this information. It looks like they haven't been used in a while. All right. Can I look around and see if I see the two faces now?","MATT: Sure, make another perception check."

Perception,"get closer and closer to the ship. You can now see it getting closer and closer. Do we want to raise our elevation as we're getting closer? Yeah, we told him to go up above it. You guys begin to notice, you, Vex, as you're looking through, the people who were playing cards start moving on the deck of the ship. They start scattering. Are they seeing us? They have seen you.

You probably have another 30 minutes before the sun hits the actual horizon line. But as you step out of one of the trees that you created previous, when you had journeyed to the ruins of Draconia, you do see about 150 feet off, the shimmer of the outside of Scanlan's mansion door. (whispers) Let's be quiet, okay? Let's do this. Oh, great. Pike's good at quiet. We stealth there.",MATT: Both you guys roll stealth checks.
Perception,"bust my balls on a daily basis. What is that about? What is that about? What have I ever done but support you? Pipe down! Calm down! Listen, how are we getting down there? Can we hurry this up, please? Throw my dagger at the ceiling. Travel with it. All right, so you watch his form vanish again. About 40 feet up, (impact). Can I land on my sister? On me?! Make a dexterity saving throw. This would be acrobatics, right. What about me?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"mansion doorway is, you crest down to where a large portion of the rubble is currently buried by snow and ice. The wind is whipping snow up into the air, and you're finding little spirals and little snow devils that are making their way through as different clusters of wind tend to swell and subside. You make your way over to the opposite side of the ravine and start heading to the north way, crawling around. I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like they're-- especially towards Vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there. Need you to go ahead and make a perception check if you could. And I need everybody to make a","stealth check, please."
Perception,"It's Arendelle! He's been carving it this week. So this circle of stones, the clusters of rock that have broken down and are sticking out, you don't know what the cultural significance of them are. They appear to have been there for a long time  these were not a recent series of landmarks that were presented here. These have been here for a while. But you do see a series of claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest of the ravine floor that you've been traversing. Can Vorugal see this spot? Curved away?","MATT: You make a perception check, Scanlan."
Perception,"been here for a while. But you do see a series of claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest of the ravine floor that you've been traversing. Can Vorugal see this spot? Curved away? You make a perception check, Scanlan. Oh, I'm great at those. We just traveled about a half-mile? Six! About a quarter mile. You don't see Vorugal from here, so probably not. I would be looking for Vorugal too, though.",MATT: Perception check.
Investigation,"from here, so probably not. I would be looking for Vorugal too, though. Perception check. Natural 20. From this perspective, it's a little ways in the way the ravine has crawled in this northeastern direction from where the lair center was. This area is not directly visible from Vorugal. You cannot see, for quite a bit, that area. Wind fingers for Vorugal. All right. Can I float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about?",MATT: Yeah. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"picked clean-- of varying sizes. There appears to be a half-eaten large insect-like carapace that's shoved off to the side. A number of creatures have fallen here and have been mostly eaten, devoured, or left to be picked apart by the other birds of prey that exist in this area. We have cover from either side of the top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine. Behind those rocks right there? Above them, all the way up here. And I'm going to take a look around and see if anybody, anything's around, anything living that looks suspicious.",MATT: Perception check.
Nature,"Behind those rocks right there? Above them, all the way up here. And I'm going to take a look around and see if anybody, anything's around, anything living that looks suspicious. Perception check. You'd think I'd be able to do this. 18. Okay. Glancing about, you can see every now and then, a few birds fly overhead. Appear to be hawks, light gray in color. They're just looking around, circling and vanishing in the distance. You do see a few small furred critters  looks almost squirrel-like, but it's too far away to make out the details, and you're not very","specifically detailed-- make a nature check, actually."
Perception,"Send the two bitties. And we're going to hide out. I'm still in my mist form. Did you guys de-mist-ify? Well, we've been talking, so I'm going to say yes. Hey, clever elves, can you scout around, make sure we're not being watched? There are no elves here. My mother was a human. Do you want to go right now? I've been keeping an eye out, but yes, I will keep watch. We're not being watched? You sure those hawks are hawks? Is anything watching us?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"I'm going to spend some time in this form just studying to see if there's anything odd about this circle at all. Studying the stones. Okay. Where is the circle? Oh. Thank you. Right, so Pike and Scanlan, you guys go mist form, make your way over back towards where the mansion was placed. Takes you a while. Are you going through the ravine, or are you going over the ravine? Over. Okay. So the two of you guys coast up to the side and over the top of the wall. There is some heavy dead forest area here, but you coast on the side of it, keeping an eye down. Both of you guys",make a perception check.
Perception,"up into the air, spirals up, then wings go out and then coasts off westward, away from you guys. Oh, away from us? Away from you guys in a western direction. Away from them, too? Away from us. He's going west. We're east. So you guys are fine. Wait. I try to make wide eyes. (gasps) Does this mean we can dig? Did we see him go in the air from where we are?","MATT: Make a perception check, actually, Vex."
Stealth,"rather briskly back towards the direction of Vorugal's lair. When you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction, start summoning. Percy? Up? Yes, please. All right. I take Percy up top. You bring Percy up onto the top. The rain is starting to come down hard now and you're instinctively getting chills and shivering a little bit. You get up into your little parapet area, place him there. I try to move some snow around and try to block it.","MATT: Percy, I need you to make a stealth check."
Stealth,"of Percy's cloak through the cover you've placed. Shit. I dive back down and try to cover him a little bit more before I head over to my side. Okay, that'll be the rest of this 30-minute preparation for you to do that. All right, who else is doing what now? I think I just peed a little. Keyleth is peeing a little. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on myself as soon as I get to the other side so I can stay stealthed on my side. Where are you staying, then? On the other ledge. Yeah. I'm trying to hide myself.","MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check. And Trinket"
Stealth,"All righty. As time begins to tick down, 15 minutes left, ten minutes left-- I cast Enhance Ability on Scanlan. Okay, you're enhancing his? Charisma. All righty. And then I am going to move. We don't have anyone over here yet, really, correct? No. You have Percy up here but no one down there. All right, I'm going to-- fuck. Going to? Hide behind the tree and stealth as much as I can.","MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check."
Perception,"About there? Yeah, sure. Okay. Remember to be super direct with his name. And his name is Yenk? Here, let me give you the script. As you pull the scroll out, fumbling in your fingers slightly, you're slightly sweaty and nervous. I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping. Okay. It takes six seconds to do, right?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"As you pull the scroll out, fumbling in your fingers slightly, you're slightly sweaty and nervous. I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping. Okay. It takes six seconds to do, right? Make a perception check. Oh boy. That's an eight. You have advantage on charisma checks. This is not charisma. This is his perception. Do we see him in the sky at all?",MATT: You make a perception check. Don't hear any
Stealth,"The blue light turns to crimson, to a deep burning red, and you hear this horrible, deep sucking sound. And you watch as Yenk the goristro is thrown from it, landing in the center of the ravine, fist to the ground-- We're going to die! Are you leaving the gate open? No, I close it instantly. Okay, the gate slams shut behind, the reddish light then now being consumed with a final blip of blue before it disappears. I'm going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion. Well, the goristro swoops the head over in",your direction. I need you to make a stealth check.
Perception,"right into the jaw, and then brings up one of its hooves and straight-up chest kicks with the sharpened hoof into the center of Vorugal's chest. It leaves Vorugal stumbling back for a second. At the end of that turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to once again beat its wings. Yenk, not being a very dexterous individual, fails and gets knocked prone once again, sending Vorugal once again up to there. Back to Vorugal's turn, he does not get the ice breath, but it looks like Vorugal actually is moving further and further away and is biding his time. I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door. Yeah, that'll work.","MATT: Yeah, you look out. Make a perception check."
Stealth,"Have you said anything in the earpiece yet? Well, you guys saw it. People inside can't hear me. All right, so comes back to the top of the round now. Yenk is currently climbing up the side. Gets about halfway up the side. Is not entirely up, but is clawing up, and you feel the impact from where you're standing, Percy. I'm holding. Going to use the rest of his action to climb up. Gets all the way to the top of the ravine, which is about at the same height that Vorugal is. Based on your help, I need you to roll another",stealth check because you helped him for the last
Stealth,"contend with, so as long as we keep it a bigger threat than us, I think he'll keep his concentration where it is. We should still try to stay out of all this. Everyone who has rolled initiative will be on the next initiative order. Vax, you're finishing up this round. Oh, I am? I would like to throw Whisper to the rock I was initially hiding behind and bamf there. Roll an attack roll. Yeah. Sure, that's 25. I would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Perception,"What are you good for? That'll be 41 points of lightning damage. Okay! Remember, she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit. One of the arcs tries to reach for Yenk and manages to disperse before it can get to it. It's not quite within range, but that finishes wherever that lightning source was. Yenk angrily is going to stand up and turn. It is going to attempt to run and grab up at Vorugal again. Come on, Yenk! Leaps and misses, (impact) landing right next to the rock. That's a natural 20 on a",perception check as it lands (impact) and looks
Stealth,"And I get sneak attack because Vax is on him. Yep. Is that Fenthras? It's Fenthras. And then 25 on the second hit. Points of damage?! No, that's just to attack. Oh, jeez Louise. (counting) 23 on the second one, with four points of lightning damage and two points of fire damage. All right. So that's your turn? And I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.",MATT: Okay. Roll a stealth check.
Stealth,"That was damage. And then the second attack hits. It's a 31. (counting) These are sharpshooter shots? It's the 1d10, plus bonus-- 1d8, plus eight, plus two for dragon, plus Hunter's Mark. Right, there we go. Second one is how much damage? 24, with two lighting damage. The first one had four lightning damage. Okay. Does that end your turn? (sighs) I want to help, I just don't know what I can do. That's all I can keep doing. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.",MATT: Go for it. Roll a stealth check.
Acrobatics,"or if it's one of the things that you can do if he attacks an enemy. The creature has to be within 30 feet of you, so no. He's way too far. 24 for the next shot. Third one does hit. That's 12 points, with two points of necrotic. And I'm going to grab my rope, and I'm going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down. Okay. I have a rope. I know you do. As you leap off the side, the clench in the stone (tink) comes loose, and you (impacts) tumble down the hill. I need you to make",an acrobatics check.
Investigation,"space underneath the air elemental. ""You ""betrayer!"" (roars) And unleash a blast of frozen death down, hitting Raishan, as well as Vax and Pike. You're unconscious. Vax, you fail a death saving throw automatically. I thought Pike had one hit point. RIght. If you make the save, you're still taking 30-something cold damage, so you're down. Automatic one fail on a death saving throw. Raishan does not make the save and takes 72 points of ice damage. Yeah, that's going to end Vorugal's turn, very angrily. All right, that brings us to Grog. Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I see any Spire of Conflux?",MATT: Make a quick investigation check.
Investigation,"into his throat and tears it out. You see the spray of blood across Raishan's mouth and across the front of the ravine as Vorugal's body falls limp onto the ground. Spits the chunk of white dragon flesh onto the bottom of the ravine. The green dragon spins around, facing you all. ""Well ""done."" And backs into a sitting position. The wings furl down and fold into her side. ""Take your ""spoils. It seems the war is nigh."" There will be a conversation. I run as fast as I can over to Pike and Vax. I run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it.","MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check."
Perception,"""circumstances?"" It's true, Scanlan, they did help a lot in that regard. ""We may not have the might to finish the dragon--"" You told us that you would have men there to help us, and there was nothing. We almost died. ""We sent men your way!"" You knew when the fight was. ""We knew when to begin the fight, but we do not have means of travelling as fast as a dragon!"" I'm running around like a cracked-out PCP addict in the background. Just looking on the ground for booty, that's all.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"represents the spoils of the remains of Draconia ""the dragon greedily stole, hoarded, and forced us to gather at the base of its icy seat. This will ""be the beginning of our new nation, and with this, we will make sure this statue comes to bear."" Good luck. Where the fuck is it?! That's all you hear me say. (laughter) What are you looking for? Help me look! For what? What are we looking for? Just dig! (laughter)","TRAVIS: Can I make another perception check,"
Investigation,"keepsakes. ""The spoils here were largely collected from the wreckage of our captors and much of the gold ""here was earned through our blood and turmoil. However, we were able to free ourselves and have ""access to this fortune a great deal thanks to your aid. We are more than willing to divide this ""between your folk and ours."" That sounds most generous. Shall we look for specifically interesting little bits, or just grab the platinum? Just grab whatever's closest and leave.

Investigation,"greatsword. It has a series of small symbols carved along the base of the blade on each side. The handle comes a gradual upward curve. It looks beautiful, ornamental, like something you'd see in a temple as part of a centerpiece. But it's weighted properly for a greatsword and is far too big for you to ever possibly muster in battle. I can't use this, so I'll just leave it. Wait! Let's not be hasty! My god, it's beautiful! Do you want it? I'm very emotional about this right now. Can I check it for traps? Check it for traps.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Oh, right. So it was most likely a sea-faring ship, and was torn asunder, from a great distance and then dragged here as part of the hoard by Vorugal. What are we going to do with a mast? I have no idea. Maybe on the way out we can see if it's uncovered any more. We'll stick a Google Maps pin here. We'll always know it's here, because when we come visit Tiberius' grave, we'll also leave some flowers and take a mast with us. They've been working on this for a while now, is it possible to wiggle my way in and check out the mast now?","MATT: Sure, make an investigation check."
Arcana,"She was doing something previously. I don't think that anything awful is going to happen. I also took this little keepsake. I call it Stoneblack. Because it's a black stone? Well don't fucking break it down like that. It's so neat. Does it look fancy? Is it magic? Why don't you Detect Magic, whoever can Detect Magic? I can't. Wait, can I? No, I can't. I can look at it and see if it looks magical.","MATT: Yeah, make an arcana check."
Investigation,"Why would a dragon keep a boat? Why would he? Maybe his woobie, you know--? Like a blankie. Yeah. You know about that, Percy? Some people like collecting ships, you know? Maybe he's a nautical kind of guy. Yeah, guns and ships. He was a nautical kind of guy. Right, yeah. (hums the intro of ""Alexander Hamilton"") While we're all standing here with our thumbs in our butts, could I look around and see if I see a little stone, a little palantir?",MATT: Make a investigation check.
Stealth,"Is there a tanner in Whitestone? One would assume we have a tanner in Whitestone. There are a few tanners, yeah. Is it super cold where I dropped off the hide? Like is it below ground? It's below ground. Yeah, it's not-- A bit chilly? Comparatively. Whitestone in general is a pretty chilly place, so yeah. But not like a fake-bake. We want a real tanner, right? Hey, while they're talking about all this, can I stealth away?","MATT: Yes, you can. Make a stealth check."
Stealth,"If I get there, are there a lot of guards keeping an eye? Not within the courtyard, no. Occasionally, there'll be one patrolling. Can I pee in the courtyard? By all means! I feel like I need to mark my territory. This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know about. It's real important in case other goliaths come around and are like, (sniff) ""Nope, the wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere."" I assumed it was shoddy masonry and everything was leaking.","TRAVIS: No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take"

Are there any guards from Emon here? Because the guards were also the guards from Emon went to Syngorn. So maybe someone in one of the guards knows one of the guards in Fort Daxio. This is a lot of work. Yeah. Is there an easier way to go about this? You could ask around? I am going to go and see if I can find one of the Whitestone guards.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"dead. You do see to the immediate northwest of your current location, clinging to the side of the a massive stronghold, built of gray and brown stone, an outer wall perimeter that completely surrounds it, buttressed against each side of the cliff, and within, you can see a multi-tiered fortress structure within, built specifically for defending against any sort of army siege or incursion. Wow, that is way bigger than I expected it to be. That's what I'm talking about. Can I check the skies? Anything flying around?",MATT: Make a perception check.

They're a little more shy. Yeah, no yeah. He was very scared. (laughter) It's all right. Next time. Does it look like anybody's in the fort looking down at us?

Nature,"underground, is there? I saw this movie called The Martian. If we shit all over everything, it'll grow. Yeah, lots of potatoes grow from shit. Maybe if we could make a composting system for them. So you can't grow anything right now? Can I get someone to take me to a courtyard, or something like that?

I was asking ahead of time, because that would be mean. Never mind. Also awesome. This one druid got to level three and then opened its own hunting emporium and never became an adventurer again.

As you guys begin stepping towards this, and it is hard to gauge distance on this city's size, even from just arriving in this place.The more you walk, the slower its arrival comes as you begin to take in the sheer immensity of its sprawling expanse.

Yeah, kind of the same thing. Okay. Continuing farther into the city. This whole city has this vibrant life to it, from the way it reflects light from the ever-changing, flickering skylight from the sun, to the flames that adorn every single conjunction of roads that make their way through the city, to occasionally, you will see cracks in the ground where a flame will flare out then retract within. Go ahead and",make a perception check.

Deception,"Get a little closer. I'm going to wave them away a little bit. I think we're cattle. I'm going to lag. I'm going to drop another 20 feet back from the group. Okay.

You are--?"" What? ""Who are you?"" I can't hear you. Oh no! No.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Persuasion,"they standing next to me? They're keeping pace with you as you're walking.

Deception,"do you want your tiefling to look like? You know, I don't have a lot to go off of except for Zahra and that one that was in front of us, so I'm going to do Zahra, like a red.

Does that mean he murdered a lot of fricking people?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Insight,"It's a back entrance, leading away from this main street. They both enter to this iron doorway. Senokir pulls something from a pocket and glances at the rest of you. He pricks his finger and places it to the edge of this object, some sort of a disk, and it has a small point on one end that he uses to prick his finger. Once he's smeared his blood on the disk, he presses it against the door, and the iron door opens up a little bit. Places it in his pocket. ""Come inside, so we may speak, please."" All right. I want to look in his eyes as we are about to go through and see if-- how honest he looks.",MATT: Make an insight check.
Sleight of Hand,"and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to it. He looks you over. ""Impressive. I think you will get no concern from myself when the other ""genasi cross your way."" (slowly) Do all of you talk like this? Do I also need to talk like this? ""I don't know what you mean."" Never mind. I go put the chains on, as well. I put the chains on. I want to put them on, but I don't want to click them. I want to hang them and make them look like they're attached, but I don't want to attach them.","MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check."
Sleight of Hand,"(softly) Yeah. Do it then. Subtly. I will stealthily pick my sister's locks. Okay. As you guys are walking past, and at this point Senokir is talking and he mentions off to the side, ""We are now passing the street of artisans and the city market. This is what we call ""the Pyraklum. This is where we're going to find Whaska. This is where we're going to find the ""Zenith Forge and hopefully the end of your journey. But we can work out the specifics later."" As this is happening, I need you to make a sleight of hand roll. Get behind Grog.","SAM: (whispers) Sleight of hand roll, boy!"
Insight,"Oh, Whaska! Is it okay if I ask one last question? ""Depends on the question. What do you ask?"" How do fire giants feel about the name, the Suutan-- Oh, wait. I already asked him that. Never mind. You know what, been a huge help. (laughter) You're not going to fist-bump, or anything? (metal ringing) Goes right back to hammering. Have you heard of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr?",MARISHA: Is it too late to roll an insight check
Athletics,"I think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time. You see two very large metallic pissing pots that currently reside at the edge of each bed. Eww, you could take a swim in it! (disgusted noises) Were you so inclined, you definitely could. But nobody in here now? Nobody in here now, no. Are there any other windows along from where I am? I know they would be a ways off. It's a ways off to the next one, but you could try to climb over if you'd like to. Yeah.",MATT: I need you to make another athletics check
Perception,"doesn't match both the glass or the blackened iron structure of this building. It's a silver plate that rests where the glass sits down. As soon as it would move, a weight would shift, and something would happen. Looking at it, do I think I could disarm it from this side? Or is it something from the inside of the room? It would need to be something from the inside. Even if you were to attempt to do it from the inside, you would have to be at the base of the structure. From this side, it's too big for you to do anything, really. Okay, and I can't see shit.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Deception,"this whole time? Yeah, sure. It's got Giant runes on it. Runes of Giant. Help me. Hey, Pike, can you help prop it up on that side? Do I recognize any of these runes? You recognize it's Giant. You cannot read. Yep. This is very important script. It says that you must carry this at all times, and if you let it go prematurely you will die. What? I don't think he's telling the truth. Better safe than sorry, though.","MATT: Grog, make a deception check."

Is this where we let the master do the talking? We're here to speak with Juuraiel. There's a small pause. You hear a voice echo from further back in the room, though you see no source for it, ""What is your business with this Juuraiel?"" We have a deal we'd like to make.

Let's hear your deal. Let them in!"" She turns around and walks across to the end of the room, as the two giants step to the side, removing their crossed swords from the entryway that scrape across the stone. And you may enter the premises. I want to look around immediately, all the walls.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"How many feet up the wall? It is about 25 to 30 feet up the wall. It's up where it's resting about the top height of the shield, so there's an even point and it's about five feet down from the ceiling. Should we let just Keyleth and Senokir up on the chairs? I would like a seat at the table, if that's all right? Let me get us out of this. Juuraiel? Do you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our guises that led us here? ""But of course. You've already presented trust from one of my allies. You are safe within here.""",LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on the whole
Deception,"matches as well. Is that true? Eyes shift back and forth over the rest of you here, ""I have an interest in games of chance ""on occasion, yes. So, you come all this way to play games?"" Yes, I have. I spend my life just playing games. It's my livelihood. I've won many things over the years. In fact, all of these great people, large and small next to me, I won in various card games around the planes. That one over there, the big one, I won him in a game of Gin Rummy in the Feywild. This guy I picked up in a game of Fish. I'm here to collect, possibly, one of your items, if that's all right with you?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Stealth,"by the way, we hear them stepping away and retrieve their weapons, and head back behind you guys. Just keeping them at their sides. So in this room, let's say you're her, and we're all where we are, and the giants are behind the group, is that about right? Yes. And how much room is there behind her and the wall? Maybe 15 feet, 20 feet. I'm going to slowly tippie-toe around the side of the wall, carefully avoiding giants. I want to stand not directly behind her, but off at an angle.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"and take a d6. Roll it and put it next to the die. All right. And now take a d4. And if we fold, do we start over? If you fold, you lose the round. Oh, well then it's just a number. So it's just numbers, at this point? At this point, yeah. You walked into a game of her choice. There's no way to cheat. So there's three rolls in a row, and she's done two. Can we see them from where I am? You currently went around the table? Yeah, I'm at an angle, but I'm a lot lower than she is.",MATT: Make a perception check.

Deception,"you do the next one, she stops and goes, ""So, as I was going to say before. How about, as your ""friends are the ante on the table, throw yourself in as well?"" And what will you give me if I win? ""Perhaps the ruby shield?"" I love myself a lot. A lot more than a bunch of rubies and a handle, I'll tell you that much. If I'm giving myself to slavery forever, I want something a hell of a lot better than that. I'm a man who's won 500 straight card games in a row. You think these slaves are something? You should see what I have at home.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Persuasion,"He's an awful-looking dwarf. ""So, are you going to buy or shall I wait for the ones I'm looking for?"" (French accent) Which ones are those? (laughter) ""Piss off."" (whispering) Offer him 15 for the pair. (French accent) (whispering) Merci. (normal volume) Would you take 15 for both of them? ""Are your ears clogged? I said ten each or 18 for the bundle!"" (French accent) Yes, but you don't seem to know where they come from, who they belonged to before. It's a risk that is possibly worth 3,000 gold.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.

We fit right in. See, there are a lot of pop-up vendors here, guys. Good to know. So if you summon your magical room-- Maybe you'll be more impressive. Makes sense. Can I survey the road in the direction of the embassy. Do we see anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.

We can totally do that. I can grapple a creature one size larger than myself. That you can. Get these fuckers locked down. DND Bob Ross reference is like Playstation trophies.

Can I revisit the days of the Crucible and can I try and suplex this motherfucker onto his side? You know what, sure. Why not? I want to! Just to get him prone, also. Yeah, because currently I'd say for the purposes of the grapple, because it takes you all of your strength to do so, you would not be able to attack with your axe while you have him grappled.

You can create enough of a crack with your spell, as it completes, which, mark off your 4th-level spell, but as you create it, you do manage to pierce, and you can look into the darkness of the tunnel behind, but through the full use of the spell, you create this kind of tunnel intrusion into the side of this mountain, and you only get that much of opening. Son of a bitch. No, this is an excellent start. All right. In spelunker-Keyleth mode, I'm looking through the hole with my Darkvision.","MATT: Okay, perception check."
Investigation,"Why? There's not enough to cover me. But Scanlan could do it or Pike could do it and could walk through the rock. And then do what? Look around, see if there's anything to-- I don't know. I prefaced it with saying it was a shitty idea, and I spoke to the brain to see if he could come up with something better. We looked for a switch, right? It's a giant rock. It's a boulder. With handholds on it. It's Fortress of Solitude. Can I look for a switch?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"rock walls of the pathway are rough, but appear to have been intentionally carved for a purpose more than any sort of presentational element of it. There's no wind, there's no movement of air. Everything in here has been, at least in this portion of it, still and untouched for quite some time. As you guys push forward through this tunnel, to where it begins to make its slow descent-- Stealth. You guys? All right. Checking, checking, checking. 24. Oh, this is investigation.

I thought you were stealthing. Oh, was that a stealth roll or an investigation roll? That was investigation, right? That was investigation. 24? Dogshit. 11. Okay. We'll have to make-- we'll say, make",new stealth checks since you guys have come out of
Stealth,"It's less than a mile down, I know. It kind of rushes past you really fast, it's a little disorienting. Okay. No traps? No traps at the moment, no. Should we all stealth? These are just here so that people step on them and it makes noise? It's a theory. We already stealthed. I thought we had to reroll stealth. Oh, I did. Can I do a-- this is some CSI shit. You guys are going stealth, right? All","right, so roll your stealth checks, please."
Nature,"30 total. 28. 25 for Pike. No, sorry. Oh, 30. 18 for Scanlan. 29 for me. Great, awesome. All right, so, as you guys continue progressing down this curving tunnel, it goes into a very, very mild descent. Can I do-- I wanna do a quick check. This is some Bones-type shit. Can I see if these bones were charred recently, or once again, if these bones have been there for a long time? I know this is some weird carbon-dating shit.","MATT: Make a nature check on this, actually. This"
Perception,"a little light to make out fine details or things at a distance, but it does help you at least make out the basic shapes and things ahead of you. You see what appear to be small shelves or alcoves that are now beginning to show up every 20 or so feet as you progress down. Little bits of rock that jut out that look like they were either bolted in or crafted on top of it, and you see small, little cubbies, almost, little alcoves that are put into the rock as well. Hold your little dagger up to it, I want to see what it is. You're sure? Yeah.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Yeah, right now I am. Okay. As you glance past, another perception check. Hey, Grog. So I have this flying carpet... 22. 22. Okay. You can see on the left shelf appears to be a humanoid skull that's up on top, next to two more candles, one of them more melted than the other, but the wax drips past. There's a shelf across the way on the opposite side that appears to have a couple of small books that are put off to the side, and what looks like a small wooden box. Is the box trapped?",MATT: Roll an investigation check.
Religion,"No, it looks kind of dust-covered. You can see what looks to be-- the bone itself appears to have a hint of blackened soot, or some sort of a darker color to it, like it's been slightly singed. Candles look like candles? Candles look like mostly melted candles. Kerr, I hate to rain on your parade, but I only see two candles and a human skull up here. Partial undead thing... do I know, again, obviously nothing is trying to eat our faces off here, but can you turn an undead thing into just like a watcher or a trap or a spy or a trigger? Make an intelligence check, or make a",religion check. Make a religion check.

Perception,"Oh man, we should totally invest in those little pantyhose eggs. Delta lambda again, sneaking in, aw. Every time! I don't know enough about that to say that correctly, either. Continuing onward, into the next length of the tunnel, about another 50 feet or so, there is-- the room opens up, and you can see that stonework eventually takes the entire floor, and the chamber opens up into what looks to be almost like a hexagonal-shaped chamber that ends at a large iron door. It fills the entirety of the chamber, and it seals off any progression from",that point. Make a perception check.
Perception,"for a second? I'm holding. You have a tiny bit of candlelight. You can see about ten, 15 feet around Vax. Okay, so I can't see the mechanism on the door. You do not even know there's a door there. Okay, that's fair. For the best, it would just scare me. I mean, would it be helpful if everyone could see? Take a look around. No one else is in this room, yeah? Can the half-elves with Darkvision do a little--",MATT: Make perception checks.
Perception,"No, you're entering this chamber, then on the opposite side of the room there is a larger door that prevents you from progressing beyond the doorway. In between you and that door, there is that raised platform, the pillar, and the iron bowl, and then to the right and against the wall, there is the brazier and the shelf with the singular tome. Does it look like-- when we entered the chamber, does it look like a door would come down or something when it opened up into the chamber? Right, is there a gap, like a crack that something could slide down out of right above where we are?","MATT: Glancing up, based on your perception rolls,"
Investigation,"19. Best you can glance here, I mean, it's possible, but this-- It's magic. You don't know. The room itself is ancient, and the construction, there is nothing that appears to be mechanically attached. So if it did, it would be magical. If that was-- Yeah, there's no chain, pulley system visible at all. Where the door hits the seam of the room, it looks very smooth. Can I go look in the bowl, the bowl in the middle of the room, and just look and see if there's a residue of anything in it?","MATT: Sure, you can make an investigation check."
Perception,"off the bottom of it on the first side and then as he made his way over, he'd be all right. You know what I mean? I don't know. Vex, Vax, and Keyleth, as you guys are having this conversation, something catches the corner of your eye, and you watch something just go (tss), just whizz past from the bottom of the ravine to the top. We saw that. We saw that. You saw something quickly just go by. Can I get a better look, can I look and see if I see it again? Yeah, the three of you guys make a",perception check as you kind of come up to the
Acrobatics,"Okay, so I wanna get a good look at one of them as they go by. Oh, it's a gif. Six seconds. Three or four more stumble past, and they're getting more and more rapid. And they're different sizes, they do not appear to be the same bodies. I pick up Pike and try to barrel roll across. Okay. Barrel roll across. As you're making it across, three more come tumbling up, two of them too far away, but one of them does reach out with its arms as it tumbles past you, and swats out to try and grab you. I need you to make an",acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"suddenly pulled, you're still grappled by this undead zombie-like corpse, and Pike is currently clutching onto the broom as hard as she can as you both impact at the end. With your weight and the creature's weight, I now get to see if the-- Vine holds? Well, not the vine. The vine magically holds. It's the chain that attaches you to the broom. Yeah, okay. So that holds. It goes taut, you're held there. The creature's still clutching you right now. Are my arms restrained? Your arms are held to, yeah. Actually, 'cause you're still held there, I want you to go",ahead and make another acrobatics check.
Investigation,"you and starts licking the side of your face. That really seemed very easy. I don't see what the big deal was. (laughter) You want to try again? I know that you're considering it reasonably. Don't put these ideas in his head. So, what are you guys doing? Move forward, I guess. All right, so you push forward-- Check for traps! Check for traps, okay. Thank you. Thank for catching my sister, thank you.",MATT: Investigation check.
Perception,"I reach down and I grab a little pebble and toss it towards the fountain. Okay. You toss it towards the fountain, the pebble clinks. And the fountain is empty, it is dry on the inside right now, on each of the lower tiers, because the water that is being poured from this face is trickling upward and hitting the ceiling. It's this steady, constant stream. Pebble. You throw the pebble into the fountain, it just kinda comes to rest. What's on the ceiling? Just flat? It looks to be just a stone ceiling, and the water's just hitting in one particular spot. If",you want to roll a perception check.
Investigation,"I'd like to move along the edge of the room, checking for traps ahead. Okay. So Vax continues forward. 19. Okay. So you coast ahead, keeping an eye out. There are no traps, but you do sense that there is some mechanism involved with this fountain. I'm gonna stop where I am, then. Okay. I'm going to walk up the wall towards, very gingerly, doing my best to check for traps or anything unusual, towards whatever it is that the water's hitting on the ceiling.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"I'm really hoping someone tells me not to. Probably maybe leave it? Wait half a minute, half a minute. I'm going to edge towards it gently, and I'm actually-- this is going to sound weird-- I'm going to spit at it to see at what range my spit decides to move towards it. Okay. So you spit at it, and your spit still kinda arcs downward, normal gravity, then it hits the water and just gets caught up in the water. Okay, so it's the water itself that's being-- something maybe in the fountain? Can I do an investigation? Can I do a closer look at the fountain?","MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check."
Stealth,"something happens. How high is the ceiling? 15 feet. Okay. Hey, Grog. If it comes to that. Don't worry about it. So what's the plan? Scootch forward, to the other side, looking for traps, looking for traps. Okay, you continue to scootch forward. I stay with Grog and Percy. I stand in between. Okay, so you guys stay back there. Okay, Kima and Allura stay back, waiting for you guys to","scout as well. Okay. You guys, make stealth checks"
Perception,"I'm waiting for everyone else to-- I'm circling to the other side of the green-- Are we all gathering up at this fork in the road? Yeah, if everyone's gonna cross the room. Okay. So you just move on? Okay. You guys continue and gather at the edge of this fork. You can see a very, very faint bit of light coming from both sides of the fork, just glancing off a distant opposite cave wall. Both have light? Both have a very, very faint bit of a light source. Two of you guys make, since you were up","front first, make perception checks, if you"
Stealth,"a very strong stream, it's just this-- like a small faucet turned on, it's all just trickling upwards, appearing, but that gem being currently blocked seems to have had an effect on the room behind. Good to know. To the right or the left? To the right! Going to the right, but hold on. Same marching order as before? I'm gonna go a little bit ahead, 20 feet ahead, looking for traps. I doubt, but I want to check for traps. Stealth and traps, stealth and traps.",MATT: You're still on the same stealth roll you
Stealth,"female human form, currently poring through books and rummaging through what currently appears to be the relatively untouched necropolis chamber. So, last we left off, the two twins had snuck ahead to take a look and take in the information of this vicinity, while the rest of the party began to slowly approach from behind. As the rest of the party is coming behind, I would like everybody else","to make a stealth check, please."
Stealth,"I put on the ring and I just leave. (all laugh) Just gone. One step. And that's how Bilbo's insurance company started. Just going home. We can start again with a real job. I'm done. 30. 30? Wait, the twins are rolling too? I should've taken that 20 for myself, then. Yeah, I thought you did. You guys are still",on the same stealth roll as last time.
Perception,"into the air of the room. ""Well, you certainly proved quicker than I anticipated, ""but I unfortunately have business here, and I would kindly ask you all to leave. ""The Conclave has served its purpose, as you have served yours. ""We have nothing more to discuss."" Turns another page of the book and continues facing away. Can I look at the ceiling, every other part of this room except for where she is, to see if she's also somewhere else?","MATT: Sure, make a perception check."
Stealth,"when you anchor yourself? Still facing away, you see the shoulders shift with a chuckle. ""I would not dare touch such a piece. It is far too dangerous. ""The soul gem is destroyed. It is of no use to me."" While that conversation's going on, I want to bamf Trinket out and send him around the other way. To the left? Around this way? With Grog. Okay, have Trinket","roll a stealth check, if you could."
Stealth,"""The soul gem is destroyed. It is of no use to me."" While that conversation's going on, I want to bamf Trinket out and send him around the other way. To the left? Around this way? With Grog. Okay, have Trinket roll a stealth check, if you could. Okay. Being a big bear. Come on, Trinket! You're so quiet-- ooh! Trinket rolls a 19.",TRAVIS: Why a stealth check?
Perception,"Poached. There you go. That one is destroyed. Poached. All right. Does that end your turn? Yeah, I'll stick with it. Okay. Next up is Vex. That's me. I'm going to immediately say over the earring, ""I don't think she's really there,"" and then try to look and see anything, any sign of her that I can spot. Can I see anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"As it goes splattering to the side of it, you can watch as what looks to be some sort of a very, very young primordial dragon like the ones that you had yanked out of the eggs before that was trying to pull its way out of the egg, slumps lifelessly over the side of the egg you destroyed. Aw. You're terrible, Taliesin. You're so hard-boiled. That's awful. I don't suppose I have time","to run a weird perception check, do I?"

Investigation,"That's awful. I don't suppose I have time to run a weird perception check, do I? Really quickly? Do I have a moment for a perception check? You've used all your action and your bonus action... I haven't burned any movement, though. What are you looking for? Is that center wall real? This center wall here? This would be",an investigation check.
Athletics,"Oh, they're all toast. But you're welcome to, if you'd like. I want to leap. There's potentially corpses in those cages that could be something. I'm focused on the egg, all right? All right, sorry. I leap toward the eggs. Okay, how far can you leap? 20 feet. All right. And I have to make",a DC 16 athletics check.
Perception,"Let's see here. There's two magical columns right there. Those aren't even there at all. Scanlan, you feel a strange, warm sensation in your chest-- Oh, you've been dispelled. Bitch. Also at the end of your turn, Grog, or as soon as your turn ends, you hear this (undead inhale) strange sucking breath-like sound. Don't do it. Listen, I like you the way you are. Don't--",MATT: (laughing) Make a perception check.
Perception,"I think there's only one corpse in each cage. I think they're like gauntlet generators and they're just like-- Quick point of order-- Yes? Spawners. Is there like corpse soup in those cages, or is it one corpse per cage? You can't really see from your perspective this far away. Well, fair. I wondered that same thing. (all laugh) For the sake of paying attention,",go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Keyleth is going to move a couple closer to the wall, that's she's close-- This wall here? Yes. Two. Forward a little bit, going towards this tunnel. Other way, other way. Other way. Taliesin literally has the laser pointer. Right there's good, that's good. Thank you. He is literally-- yeah. Can I take my bonus action to do a",perception check and see if I can sense
Perception,"which is hasted, to slide around this way and crouch ten feet in front of Keyleth. There. I think that's Keyleth you're moving. Oh no, I'm sorry. Ahead of Keyleth. Between Raishan and her. Right there? Yeah. Cool. All right. Vex, you're up. We're just in a nice line. Okay, I'm going to-- I saw Keyleth say that she was in fog, so can I come around that corner and see her?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"All right, cool. I might hide behind that stalagmite. That ends your turn. Percy, you're up. Did I see this go down? You're over here watching the egg off in the distance, and you watch her fire a couple arrows and then rush around the corner, and you hear the slam into the ground. Though you can see the fog moving around and there's thrashing. If you wanted to try and attack something,",you'd have to roll a perception check.

Let's
Stealth,"I'm going to run over to Allura and I'm going to cast 3rd-level Cure Wounds on her. Okay. Healing her-- 3d8 plus three. Fifteen points. All right. And then... 30 feet, no. Fuck! That's my action, isn't it? Mm-hm. I guess as a bonus action I'm going to... hide? I'm such a loser. So you're going to move over here and hide? Yeah? I guess? Okay, so go ahead and roll a",stealth check.
Stealth,"going to... hide? I'm such a loser. So you're going to move over here and hide? Yeah? I guess? Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check. Okay, let me see if I have any health potions left, though. I have a regular healing potion left. Go for it. So I'm going to take that. It's 2d4 plus two. Ooh! Eight points healed. All right.

Perception,"And with that, the breath escapes Scanlan's lungs, the smile across his face, as life leaves his form. This time I died with a bad joke and piss all over me. (All laughing.) He died as he lived: hard or after a bad joke with piss all over him. All right. That ends Scanlan's turn. Grog, you're up. Yeah. Uh. Dragon moved. Scanlan dead. (raspberry) Did I detect which direction el dragon flew in?",MATT: Roll a perception check.
Perception,"Okay. All right, that ends Kerrek's turn. Let's see here. Kima sees you doing this and is going to go ahead and back you up right there. Sorry, Percy. Yeah. Spiderclimb makes you so easy to knock over. Kima, on her turn... is going to use Aura of Vitality again on herself and, utilizing that as a bonus action, is going to heal you for 2d6, Kerrek. So-- oh, not bad. 11 hit points. All righty. That ends Kima's turn. Allura. Allura, who is barely conscious with 15 hit points, is going to get to her feet.",Perception check... natural 20.
Acrobatics,"attack. 53 points of damage. Come on, come on. Come on! Second attack is also getting, okay, so one, just one, okay. Plus five and... eight. All right. And I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage and just leap away from her and just tumble-crash to the ground. Okay. Does she still have an attack of opportunity against disengagement, or did that legendary action-- No, disengage doesn't have to. Make","an acrobatics check, though."
Athletics,"That's going to end Raishan's turn. Grog, you're up. Yeah! Grog would like to get up. Stand up. What does that take for me to do that? That's half your movement. 25. Half my movement. Can I use the rest of my movement to run towards dragon-dick? Towards dragon-dick? Yeah. 25. That's as far as you can get. Can I use the boots of feral leaping to leap even further.",MATT: Make your athletics check.
Investigation,"and scattered on the ground, and the magic is fading. There is one book that is actually in a chest that she goes and partially opens, there is a book inside that is emanating some magical essence. There is the doorway across the way. But there is just a general magical presence, like a faint magical energy everywhere in here. Which doorway across the way? On the far end. There is a doorway. Oh, there is? I run over to inspect it.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"I don't understand. No, Kima! Kima! And Kima just walks in after her. Sparks once more. Does anybody know what the fuck-- What did that mean? What was that supposed to look like? What it was supposed to look like? Can we do some sort of check? I don't know arcane. I don't either. (tearfully) Scanlan does. (tearfully) Scanlan does. He would know.",MATT: You can make an arcana check.
Perception,"Okay. One thing at a time. This is taking everything to not stay here. Okay. Still moving towards the beach, looking for live trees. A short time later, you eventually get close to the edge of the waterline, and you do find a handful of trees that appear to be alive enough and large enough to maintain one of your spells. I do a useless scan of the ocean out of desperation to see if I see anything.",MATT: Perception check.
Athletics,"they're both having a hard time treading water, and they're swimming in the wrong direction. I fly over them and just tell them, ""Hang onto the broom!"" ""Oh, that's the best thing I could've hoped for seeing."" And Allura reaches up and grabs your arm and says, ""Kima, hold on!"" And grabs the edge. You can see Kima now is like coughing up water and is trying desperately to tread water. That's a natural 20 on a strength check for Allura. Holy shit. With no modifier. Manages to hold onto both you and Kima and keep you up.",I need you to make an athletics check.
Investigation,"You actually see two gnolls and what looks to be a goblin that are wandering amongst those people in the street. Kymal is, and you've passed through before. Kymal is-- it's the real-- it's the seedy Reno of Tal'Dorei, if you will. I mean, Reno's already pretty seedy, so. It's not Laughlin level. It's not-- sorry, Laughlin. Sorry, Reno. Go ahead and make an",investigation check.
Persuasion,"He died with piss all over him. That sounds like my father. Will you go? And what? Will you help? Kaylie. And help what? I set her on the table so we're still eye-level. All his words were of you. Look, I know a little bit about having a father who wasn't around. Right? Take it from me. It's not worth it. It's not worth harboring this hatred in your heart. If you can find it in yourself to forgive him, you'll live a much happier life.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"So awkward. Deuces. There you go. (laughs) Deuces. The dragon destroyed. However, their friend, Scanlan, still lifeless and still, growing colder as the minutes passed. Picked up his body and you fled the cavern to the outside of the island after discovering the teleportation or, at least, the magic of transport had some sort of an alteration or a funkiness to it, if you will. You watched as two of your allies, Kima and Allura, were, instead of teleporting away through a circle, sent deep out into the ocean. You managed to find them",(laughs) through a very lucky perception roll.
Persuasion,"know me after. While my best buddy Pike taught me to love, you taught me to laugh, and I don't want to know what life is like without that. And the last thing I'd say is, you spent so many times inspiring me, I'd like to take a page from your book. And to the tune of the Washington Redskins fight song-- (laughter around the table) I sing (singing) Hail to Scanlan Shorthalt Hail to victory! No one can make me laugh faster. Please bring him back to me.",MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check with
Performance,"your whole fucking town. (all laugh) You see, I love this gnome very much. He's small like me, but he's touched. He's raided and slain, He's pooped while he sang, But if he's gone forever I won't be the same Now that he's learned he's a dad, The journey that all of us had Cannot be in vain Will not be in waste. Please, Scanlan, open your eyes and see your daughter's face. I'd say go ahead and make-- make a",performance check with advantage.
Performance,"pick up, and she begins to dance, her feet clacking across the top of the altar. The juxtaposition of the energy and the emotion of the room towards this strange rush of energy and liveliness is awkward at first, and then welcome, and you can't help but, in spite of yourselves, smile. The sound fills the room as she goes faster and faster and faster, her feet clacking, faster and faster, across the stone work on the top. She brings it to a giant crescendo, finishes with a flourish, the bow (makes a whooshing noise) outside. She puts her head up, and you see the tears streak down her face, no smile, just a stone expression, and she gives a bow.","That's a performance check on that. The third, and"
Performance,"talk."" and slaps his face the other way, jumps off the altar, slams out the two doors to the front, and staggers out of the temple into the outside. Scanlan still lays unconscious but breathing. I rolled a natural fucking 20, by the way guys, on that final roll. Did you really? No way. It's right there. I haven't touched it since it landed. That was two natural 20s. Two! Two natural 20s. It was 14 for Kaylie's","performance roll, and then a 20."
Medicine,"There was--I mean with the DC increase, because he was at a 12. I missaid 13 last week, it was a 12, and we had two successes and one failure. That brought it from a 13, ten, to a seven. So we had a one through six and he would have been good. Oh, good. That responsibility is so scary. Yeah. Anyway. As you all take in the moment, it appears that Scanlan's spirit has returned to the body. Anybody wanna wake him up? No. I don't think so, not yet. Keyleth goes up and does a simple","medicine check, just to see what's up with him."
Insight,"you watch as Kima immediately pushes up ""Is he--?"" He'll be fine. ""(sighs and then scoffs) And you were worried. So dumb."" (laughs all around) Allura steps up behind her and puts her hands on Kima's shoulders and goes, ""Well, that's good news. Take care of him. We'll probably return to Emon and help helm the ""remainder of the cleaning, and situation, of Emon: gather the dead, see who we still have alive, ""and come back soon with an idea of what we have to rebuild.""",MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?
Perception,"How do you feel about that? I've had friends come and go through the years. It's part of the job. That can't be true. That cold... Well, no. Each one hurts, but-- Look, doll, I've lived in some of the harshest landscapes Tal'dorei and beyond has to see. I've watched people torn asunder in the streets before me. I have-- I hold onto my purse the entire time talking to him. Okay. (all laugh) That was so subtle.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah. (laughs) And then when it does not-- when it dead ends, I just drink as much of that bottle as I can, moving it back and forth between the two of us for the rest of the night. I'm good with that. Do I hear them at all on the other side of the door? You hear them muttering from across the wall, but do you wanna listen in? I was actually hoping to be around the corner for a chunk of this, 'cause I was heading to Scanlan's room as well.",MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks.
Insight,"serum. Serum. Did they teach you that in your Sarenrae temple classes, because if not, maybe you have a thing or two to teach them now. Probably not, Grog, but thank you. All right, now I am coming around the corner. I've waited long enough. So, Percival, you hear just enough to hear the talk about needing a body and then alcohol. Percy, the gods gave you two hands for bottles for each of them! Four if you can learn to use your feet. That's too much. My brain will explode.","ASHLEY: Can I insight check him, since I knew,"
Investigation,"to Whitestone? Jarett is recovering. Okay. Did he come back with us, or is he still in Whitestone? Jarett's still in Whitestone. He's like, ""Fuck you!"" Jarett's proud and excited about the things you've accomplished, but Jarett needs a vacation. He's got to find some drugs, too. Yeah. He's not happy about that. Modify Memory. (laughs) If you want to roll an","investigation check, Vex."
Perception,"If anything, that means we came to Emon for nothing-- Yeah, pretty much. --except to go to our Keep. We made a double-check. Yeah! We had to make sure everything was alright here. It was a free ride. That's true. Cool! To the keep. And as I'm walking through, I keep an eye out to see if there are any Ashari lingering around but I'm sure they've all bounced at this point.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"There are a couple of small oil lamps that are hanging from the walls. They are not currently lit, and the forge is dark, cold there-- most of the tools have already been stolen or taken, anything that can be grabbed by hand is gone. Are there any of those dangerous buckets of water around? There are a couple, and it smells of stale hard water. Treacherous. (all laugh) Don't really know what I'm looking for. Are there any like powders? Like sacks of powder--",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Are there any like powders? Like sacks of powder-- Make an investigation check. --crates of powder, or-- Oh, that's not terrible! 14. You do find what looks to be a small brown wooden barrel-type container. It has a lid on it, but it's easy to pull off. And on the inside it has a familiar smell that you catch whenever you see Percy fiddling with his weapons, sort of a dark powder substance. Can I pour a little out? Yup. Looks like soot or charcoal dust, grainy like sand. Can I have snuck down and be watching this?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah, we're not gonna get into any fights, right? Not if we can help it. Okay. That's the hope. Grog, why are you making that face, Grog? I'm holding my breath. Why are you holding your breath? Hiccups? No fights at all? Like, what if we run into bad people? If we run into bad people, we can fight them.",TALIESIN: Can I roll a perception check on his
Insight,"Right. She said it had a faint magical aura of protection. But it was protection. Could you shake it like a yuletide present? No. No. Maybe it's actually somebody requesting that we do something that is nice then, which I feel like never happens. (all laughs) From what I remember from my-- I can look, right? I don't trust anybody anymore. From Senokir, cause didn't I do",an insight check?
Investigation,"I feel like I remember-- It's your say, go for it. I think we should make a tree and head in that direction. Well, we already have a tree, but yeah. All in favor of jumping through that tree-- Make like a leaf and wait-- Make like a tree and leave. (Laughs) Yeah. I don't know, ask him. Was the box already checked for traps? You don't know. Can I check it for traps?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"30. It is locked, there are four individual locks in each side-- Four locks? And it appears that there is some sort of a-- usually when something like that has a little bit of give against the chain, the box has none. That usually either means it's adhered or it's sealed magically. Pickle, I will help you if you want, but my gut is telling me that this is just his wife's ashes. Shake it. Listen. I second that.",MATT: Make a perception check.
History,"there a tree there? There are a number of trees, actually. A number of the homes are actually built in-- In trees? That's cool. Sick! I want a tree house! Okay. And you said it's safe, this isn't arcane, it's natural, since Melora, I'll probably be okay? People aren't gonna look at us weird when we come out of a tree on the other end? I mean, when you come out of a tree people probably look at you weird anyway. Sure. Do people bury their dead here?",MATT: You don't know. Roll a history check.

Apparently, yes, this was where she came from.",ASHLEY: We both did a history check. 15.
Nature,"you see the cold landscape, or at least the cold sky of Vasselheim, though surrounding you it is just verdant green. You can see moss and bushes and grass, and a number of tree trunks around you. You can see a very clear-cut path that walks through like an intentional park walkway. As you all emerge, you find yourself looking up into the relatively grey, heavily cloud-covered sky, and it is very cold. You watch as very, very faint snow drifts to the ground, but it doesn't touch, it immediately evaporates before it hits the ground. It seems either the warmth of the area or an enchantment of some kind is resistant to the weather of this northern continent.",MARISHA: Can I do a quick nature check to see if

Insight,"They awkwardly continue walking. Ask them where the Birth Heart tree is! Do you know where the Birth Heart tree is, actually? She stops and turns back. ""The Birth Heart is two paths up and to the right. It's hard to miss."" How long have you guys lived here? They kinda look at each other, back at you, awkwardly. ""My entire life. She lived up north in Crossin but moved here ten years ago."" And you've never heard of a Zaafin? No.",ASHLEY: Insight check?

And you've never heard of a Zaafin? No. Insight check?","MATT: Yes, make an insight check."
Perception,"And you get the sense that's probably the Birth Heart. Does it kind of remind us of Sondur's tree? Sondur was a singular tree. This, from what you can tell, appears to be a cluster of many trees. Okay. Do we proceed towards it? Yeah, we do. Yes, yes. All right. You guys push on, and as you approach-- Can we keep an eye out for guards? Anybody that might be watching us?","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"standard Bastion armor set, per se, but they do have elements of colors and cloths that symbolize their station as well as some pins or badges that mark the symbol there. So you do pick up on a few of them, and they're just kind of doing the rounds, and there are a couple that are curiously keeping their distance and keeping an eye. But not following you, just, hm. Bidet. Bidet? Can I keep an eye out for any kind of tombstones or anything in the area that looks like anybody else might have done similar things?",MATT: Sure. Perception check.
Investigation,"forest? (defeated) Technically, yes. That was the saddest advantage I've ever seen. Perception, you said? Yes. That's a 20. Okay. As you walk towards the Birth Heart, and you get towards the outside of this large cluster of towering trees, you do not see anything that would be a tombstone per se. Occasionally you do see a cluster of stones. Can I check 'em out and see if it looks like--","MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check."
Religion,"Pike, would you bring the box over here, please? Would you pray with me, please? Well, I-- Matt, can I ask you a question? (all laugh) Yeah, yes you may, Ashley. Holy shit! That got serious! Oh, legit! Is it respectful to-- Spike the box! -- when you're at a place of another god's worship to-- I know we did at the resurrection ritual, but to bring another god into it?",MATT: Roll a religion check.
Perception,"It's like a bare-knuckle fight. Yeah, it's pretty much fisticuffs in the Crucible. They got gnome fights there? They got gnome fights? They got gnome fights? (laughs) That sounds like a blast. I wanna see if I can find two small stones while we're walking through the path. I wanna find two pretty reasonable fire-starting stones. Flints, you mean? Yeah, just a flint.","MATT: Okay. Make a perception check-- well, this"
Athletics,"The wisdom saving throw was something in the beginning. Yeah, I think it was, you have to shake his hand or do something, like, gentle to him. I like the idea that it's silent in here and we're just hearing sand get kicked around and Grog breathing like a bull. I like to think that Earthbreaker Groon has, like, mood music for his fights. Agreed, yeah. There's frustrated grunts happening. He's got a sound system.","MATT: So, make an athletics check."
Athletics,"kind of earth-side punch into your torso. Not the double fist! It's about to push you backward, but you dig in your feet (grunts) and resist it and hold your place. Yeah!

I want to pick him up and try and bodyslam him.",MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Investigation,"I wonder what Scanlan would say if he were here right now? Fucking come back and get me! (all laugh) Yes, yes. He's asleep. Very asleep. (snores) In a coma. Shit. Do quick shopping and then head home and look at all the things. A quick buying of potions, I just wanna see if I can get some stuff.",MATT: Make an investigation check.

What, are you going after treasure? I'm going after many things. I have a long list of things I want to tick off. Are you famous? Of course I am. You haven't heard of... Well, you haven't heard of me yet because my book hasn't come out yet. Doty here is recording my legendary adventures as I travel around the continents. How thick is the book?",MATT: It's pretty thick. Make a perception check.
Insight,"I knew you were special when I ran into you all, my goodness. Hey, buddy boy, we have to go to the Nine Hells in the not too distant future, are you down for that? Well.  Hold on, let me check my list.... that is on the list. It was... lower down, but, it's another thing I have to tick off before I'm a real adventurer! So, I'm up for anything if you are. Hm. I do not like you. This fucking asshole, am I right? This fucking asshole.",TRAVIS: Can I insight check Asshole?
Perception,"I would love to hear. Hold on. Wait, one more! Another round, I've got it, I've got it. Treev's already on it. Treev is like, ""Oh, don't worry. I'm loving this."" Then he's just pouring all of you glasses and shoving them forward to you guys and crossing his arms. Maybe some meats too, if you have any. Or cheeses. We ain't got meat. Oh. I want to keep an eye-- I'm keeping an eye out for any kind of questionable behavior.","MATT: All right, perception check. Go ahead."
Insight,"the crowd, as you guys watch-- I am watching this-- Oh yeah. Tary kind of puts his arm on her shoulder-- Don't touch me. Leads her over to the corner. Don't touch me.

(all laugh) Does it look real?",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Perception,"So your... Doty? Yes? Dottie. Dottie, sorry. Doty. Duty. Duty. Got it. Does he fight or does he just write? He does what I tell him to do. Is he competent in a battle? I would say so. Has he ever been in battle? Doty has been in a battle. Does he look like he has any battle scars? Glancing over and getting a quick look--",make a perception check actually.

Perception,"We are going to Hell. All right. And you are coming along. And we're taking you with us. Shouldn't we see him fight first? Yeah, well, let's bring him home.

No, not in the city, Grog. I'm not talking to you.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"fresh growing season of green back there, and that is closed off. It is protected. There are guards around and it is away from the general populace of Whitestone. Nice. This looks like a great place. Now, if you want your first taste of adventure, you need to bring Dottie and come over here. Doty. I have to whisper it because it's very secret.

Insight,"That's terrible. Drink up, by the way. Oh, thank you. So how long have you been set forth on your little mission to prove yourself worthy? Month, month and a half. Really?

History,"Yes. Well-put. As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever we're trying to go? It's easier to teleport if you're already been there. Ooh. Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never been there.

It's medium armor, it's not too crazy, you're fine. But you with a much heavier splash.

Stealth,"All right, you guys hear Keyleth begin to inform you as you hear off to the left side of the ship two localized sounds-- it sounds like wood slamming into wood or some sort of a heavy impact, two in rapid succession. And you watch as from out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks slam into the ship with chains behind them that suddenly grow taut. The rest of the crew begins to turn around and move their ballistas in the direction of where the chains come from, but you still see nothing there. The fog is too thick. I'm going to hide.","MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check."
Athletics,"I'm going to come up and, in the path as the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire the ship? Okay, well, you can only Faerie Fire creatures in a small area, a ship-- It's not going to do it. --probably shouldn't be Faerie Fire.

Fair enough. Can I drift down to where I can see anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog? Can you do anything about the fog? On their ship? Yeah. Okay. So as you coast down a little lower,",I want you to make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"right at the edge of the ship right there. Done. Okay, just for funsies I will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of Trink. Okay. So, that is not that good. Ooh. That's a 13. Okay, yeah. Even with disadvantage. Okay. So this one you fire, and just disappears off to the side of the ship, but returns to your belt. Are you gonna stay where you are? No, I'm gonna drop down. Okay. And circle around Trinket's tush.",MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check.
Perception,"Are you gonna stay where you are? No, I'm gonna drop down. Okay. And circle around Trinket's tush. All right. Make an acrobatics check. Sure. Just to land from the top there. Yeah, 25. Yeah, you're fine. So you move around behind Trinket. All righty.  That ends your turn, Vax. Percy, you're up. Okay, I'm gonna take a quick look around to see if I can figure out what's causing this fog because it's annoying me.",MATT: Perception check.
Athletics,"No. All right, so, they get one rapier strike towards you. That is going to be nine points of piercing damage. Halved. As it just cuts across the center of your armor in the midsection. It doesn't actually get the skin, but it's enough of an impact where you can feel a bruise coming. Tight. All righty. Ending their turn, that brings us to Keyleth. Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat? You are, yes. I'm gonna climb up that boat.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check."
Athletics,"elemental and take a strike on it and misses. (whoosh) It goes and strikes, but the water elemental shifts out of the way, the blade moves past, without an impact. End of the round, we have Taryon. Yeah! Taryon! Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone, right? Yeah, he's splashed back. Both of these guys are in the water, back ten feet. Oh, they're gone. Okay. Yeah. Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.","MATT: Okay, athletics check."
Perception,"God, robot! All right, ending that round, that brings us the ships continue to move forward  both of these guys shift backward. Bye! They're being left behind by the boats. Good! They're trying to swim forward. That brings us to Marid. Okay. I've been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months. So this guy is currently up in the side. And he's looking around, he's gonna make a quick","perception check, just to look around. He got shot"
Acrobatics,"Okay, I'm going to, if I can pull this off, is it possible that I can break the rope that I'm currently holding onto and do a little Errol Flynn like fly down to the bottom of the boat? You can do that, yeah. Is it possible that the rope I have to shoot is in between me and him? Uh... sure. You going to kill two birds with one stone?

However, (creaking noise) I'm going to stop, I'm going to wave, and I'm going to go walk over and start looking to see if I can see what that glow is. I'm going to deactivate this, because I want to loot this ship.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Six seconds of dialogue, right there! All right, we'll say for the pace of things here, guys, the ship is maybe 30 seconds from fully sinking into the water. Anybody you guys wanna-- 30 seconds? I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm gonna go and land next to Keyleth. Okay. See if we can grab the orb.

I travel as a merchant with a lot of coin, so I found these two at a leper colony and nursed them back to health. It was also a gym, a muscle-man place, so they're really buff.

I mean, it takes up the entire doorway, essentially, and it's just pivoting after it notices you guys, so you're gonna have to make a tumble check to try and make it past him. Oh, okay, hold on then. An acrobatics roll, but yeah. I'll-- you know what, I'll do the acrobatics roll to try and shut the door, and-- Okay, so you're trying to, basically, as he goes to spin around, you dash forward, and roll into a tumble to try and pop up on the other side,",so go ahead and roll acrobatics check.
Stealth,"got this shit! You got it! And I'm going to cast Enhance Ability, and I'm going to give him enhanced strength. So any strength checks you make are with advantage. Though you already have that while raging. Oh wait, what? When he rages he gets advantage on his strength checks. Make him smarter! Smarter, handsomer, more stealthy-- Can I make him smarter? Or more stealthy? I'm going to give him enhanced dex. Okay, Cat's Grace. So you have advantage on",any stealth checks you make.
Perception,"Is anybody right next to it? Tova's right next to it. All right, so that's Sneak Attack damage. So that is four plus eight is 12, plus psychic damage, that's 19, plus the Sneak Attack damage is 22, 26, 27, 32, 37, 40, 44 total. Okay. You eviscerate the lemure. You watch as you jam your dagger through it multiple times, and each section you carve off of it, it splits open, leaving these stringy tendrils of flesh and tendon behind as it wails and shrieks to the ground, slowly dissipating into a thick sludge. For my new vantage point, do I see the winged creature that you had referenced?",MATT: Make a perception check. As you make a
Stealth,"female devil who is pushed into the wall and torn into the chest terribly. You guys just see and hear this in the distance, you don't actually watch the impact happen, but you hear the screaming and Trinket roaring as it strikes into it. Shit. Well, that's loud. Hey buddy, try to stay quiet! You get the sense that it's going to be real hard to try to maintain a sense of stealth in this stronghold now. So that ends your turn. Grog, you're up. I run after-- I use my bonus action to hide as well.","MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check."
Perception,"Women are powerful, and amazing. That's right. It was just very high-pitched, is what I mean. Right, and there's nothing wrong with that. Except it gives away our position in this endeavour. But did you see? I slew that-- slew? Slayed? Is slew a past tense of slay? Slew. Do I have any way of knowing if this is Utugash in the next room? Can I do a wisdom check with my bear smell?","MATT: Yeah, make a perception check, with"

(laughs) Yeah, he doesn't get saving throws, he gets skills from you, but he has advantage on saving throws from traps. Still cool. Do I see anything through the doorway, from where I'm standing?","MATT: You step forward, make a perception check."
Perception,"the Dwarven Thrower, though, the hammer. Right, right, the hammer, okay. Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage? You may. Thanks. And I don't get to attack. Yeah. What color is pit fiend blood? It's a dark, dark blackish-purple. All righty, that ends Grog and Tova's turn. Percival. That's looking really crowded over there. I'm going to wander over to that first prison cell and take a look inside that door. (gasps) Percival!","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"legendary action, and does another maneuver with his finger like that. He did another thing. He did another gesture? What gesture? What did he do? Oh, fuck! Same thing. He did this. Gang sign, gang sign. Oh no, people are watching. Was it this thing? So, at the top of the round-- The only people in the room right now, Keyleth is face-first on the ground. I need Tova and Grog to","make perception checks, if you could."

Trinket's got a really good sense of smell.",MATT: Have Trinket roll a perception check.
Perception,"You don't think so. He's in the fire, right? He's in the fire, yeah. Oh god. Is he making some sort of window that someone else could walk over? No, the flames curl around, sorry. All right, so that ends Taryon's turn. Good, I'm glad I used that last little thing. (laughter) Killed my best friend. Tary, it's your only friend! At the end of the turn, the pit fiend sticks a hand out of the flames and does this motion.","Make a perception check again, Grog."
Stealth,"That ends Taryon's turn. If I don't look, he'll go away! That brings us to Keyleth's turn. Where are the little pissant guys? There's one there right next to Grog, and one right next to Doty. So there, and there. I'm going to hop through the window again. I'm going to cast Sunbeam. Are you gonna move in to try and get them both in the same path? Yeah. Sunbeam it is. Matt, can I use my bonus action to at least Hide?","MATT: Sure, roll a stealth check. So it's a"
Athletics,"can do that. Is that what you want to do? Let me-- can I grab this cage and put it between-- this cage is just sitting out, got to do something. Can I throw the cage at that guy who's standing there? He's there, right? You can. Go ahead and make a strength check. You have advantage because you are in your bear form. (laughs) That is a 14. 14 is fine, that's enough. No, wait. 13. What? Didn't you roll an eight? Plus your strength of ten. So 18. Oh yeah. Bears are great at math.","MATT: Sorry, this would be an athletics check to"
Intimidation,"12,300 gold. So you have that at your disposal now. I go over, and I'm really happy to put my armor back on over my cool bear bikini that I have on. (laughter) Your bear-kini. As you're putting your armor on, you open the far door on this end, and as you do, suddenly bursting through is a lemure.

Deception,"manacles out from sacks and satchels. Two of them immediately charge up and begin shackling Grog, multiple layers of chain and manacles across your arms and legs. They shackle you up and begin to spread into the next room, coming to the rest of you guys. They charge in and begin just, throat manacle, to arms, to ankles, each with somewhat slack chains and has a specific lead chain attached to the center of the whole ensemble. They go from person to person, they throw them on you, though you angrily give in to it. Keyleth, as you approach, one of them turns to you and goes (speaks Infernal).

Perception,"minutes of walking, when there's a crowd gathered around, some of the devils will go ahead and crack one of you in the back of the knee and give off a showing of ownership and a general sense of cheer emerges with each person that gets smacked in the back of the head or thrust down. Percival, you get, at one point, hit along the side of the jaw and you feel the blood fill the side of your mouth, as you wish you could rub it with your hand, though the way the chains are pulling prevent you from raising your arm too high. You hear the hissing and the occasional rocks being thrown from the distance as you're pulled through. Vex and Vax, go ahead and roll","perception checks, please."
Investigation,"Which are in the satchel on the other side of the bags, right? So you Thorn Whip that over. You catch it. You rummage through the pouch that he usually keeps his equipment in. You find the lockpicks that Vax usually uses. I got it! Okay, bring it over here, love. Okay. Do you have any extra? You can pass them to me and I can maybe help.

You come up to what looks to be a right and left. Wait, what? Wait, only a right and left? But we have two straights in a row! We go straight! Yeah. Is there any hidden door here? Search for a hidden door. We go straight into the wall! I'm searching for a door, as a bat. Straight, in the door, keep going straight.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"This has been a weird day. Aren't you glad you're playing with us? Tary's got wings coming out of his head. As you guys are flying, in this new chamber it is pitch black. Thankfully, your vision allows you as best to see. Tova, you start having the recurring memory of the fact that you're not sure where they're going, where they're taking you, but you still have people in this prison. Yeah. Am I looking out? Do I recognize anything that we're passing? You have no idea where they are and you have no idea where you are currently. Can I use my heightened senses to do a",perception check and see if I can smell anything?
Investigation,"behind. You hear conversation, different languages happening. They're getting a little more distant. You're catching some ground here, and it's going well. Eventually you make your way-- Jesus, there's another whole fucking map? The doors, always. This is Matt Mercer we're talking about. I'm looking for fucking traps. You guys make your way down to the end of this chamber, and you see three different doors that are all closed off, to the front, to the right, and the left. Fanged smiles. Fanged smile.","MATT: As you're making your investigation check,"
Investigation,"attached to it. It's like the whole ceiling and upper portion of this chamber is made of chains that are feeding it. Do we have anything to freeze? To freeze? Yeah. We have our shit back, right? Yeah. If we can freeze him in place, maybe. He's made of metal. 25 to 20. 24. 24. 21. Tova. And what did you roll for your",investigation check earlier?
Investigation,"15 to ten? 13. Taryon? Two. Wow. Eight for Vax. All right. Vex, you're up first. Can I run to the other doors that Vax has been looking at? Which one of these are you checking? Huh? Which one of these doors are you checking? The far one in the back. Yeah. And I'll look for the symbol.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus to pop Trinket out. Okay. Trinket appears out of your necklace. I guess he was already out, wasn't he? Because we were running. Yeah, but you may have pulled him back in. It's fine. That's a waste of bonus. (laughs) No, I'm going to Hunter's Mark. So Trinket was out. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the guy. All right, I'll go with it. Hunter's Mark on the chain golem. Tova, your turn. Okay. I'm going to run over there behind the chain golem where Vex is. I'm going to do a",perception check.

Investigation,"any of these prisons? Sure. Make a perception check as you're rushing in. What about symbols? Do you see anything? With advantage. Yep. All right. So that is a 23. 23. The chambers seem to have various scents that kind of mix in this area. The one on the far end has this ancient, dusty, decay smell to it. The one on the opposite side of the chamber has a weirdly iron, rusty old metal scent, and the doorway that you're at right now has a very strong scent of sulfur. Is there anything on the door?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"cube, right? Yeah, again, you can see out. These metal beams going up that lead to nothing, and are just sort of mangled. Wait, give me a boost, I'm going to climb up the beam. Okay. I'm going to try to climb up the beam, because it's covered in vines, right? I can grab on to something. Absolutely. Okay. I'm going to try to climb up to the top. Okay, we'll help.",LIAM: Make an athletics check.
Perception,"the whole jungle you're in, sunlight does come down and in, but it's pretty dim overall, and everything is tinted with that color. And you see these lumps of hardened, what look like-- they don't have the texture of coconuts. They have the texture of a chestnut, maybe. But they're just growing out of spots on trees. Some are hanging from a vine on different trees. And you can't see where to go. Everything looks the same in different directions, although it is more open from this view, because down below, between these four beams, it's all wrapped around. And you see two little kids going like this. And I don't see any other sign of life?",LIAM: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"Okay! Oh, you know? Okay! It should be. I think it's Travis! Let's go! All right, so after you scuttle down and have this little mini child argument. It's not too hard, I mean, you just pull apart vines and plants, and you can push your way through. Be careful of the bulging sausages! Everything is slick to the touch, and you grease by it all-- Of the wet, bulging sausages! I think that's sound advice. Hashtag. Are you stealthing there? Yeah, yeah, we're sneaking.","LIAM: Well make a stealth check, motherfuckers."
Nature,"Turgid. Turgid, yes. I want to break off a few sticks and try to turn them into sharp daggery sword things. That's fine, I'll be covered. You, Marisha, as you tear down a huge chunk, are just Carrie'd. Just (squishing noise) as you rip it off. When you break, whatever sap or whatever it is that's in there feels hot and is dark red and it spatters you. So you are now blooded. Does it smell like blood? Is it blood? Yeah, I'm going to smell it and do a little bit of a taste test.",LIAM: You want to make a nature check?
Athletics,"Are you? Yeah. I'll go with it, and I have the stick, I'm just going to be like-- I'm going to hide behind the flower that Matt came out of. Okay, so you guys are all finding hiding places? Oh, we're hiding? I don't until everyone else starts-- It's getting closer. I hide. It's multiple locations, too.

You can't lift the whole thing or hold the whole thing because it's eight feet long. As you pull it out, it's so soft, it breaks at one spot, but there's no question what that is. This is exactly a gate entry bar. I'm going to make a wild guess. I'm going to see if there's a little boxhouse nearby. Yeah, can I assist him on that? Sure. Where it would be, physically. I'm getting a sneaky suspicion--",LIAM: Make an investigation check.

Are there any working flashlights in the security booth?",LIAM: You can make an investigation check. You

Stealth,"Oh, that made me happy. We go by her hovel. Okay. As you guys make your way back to the castle you stop and go over there. You can see it's one of three small homes that are jammed in the alley areas between these larger buildings. Almost like there's businesses on this one corner and they have smaller people that are living more meager means. Each one of them appears to be occupied. The one that she pointed to, you go to it and it seems... there. There's like a very low light through one of the windows. I'm going to be real shitty and stealth up and peek in and see what she's up to.","MATT: Okay, make a stealth check."
Insight,"I'm going to be real shitty and stealth up and peek in and see what she's up to. Okay, make a stealth check. She's changing. Crying, naked. We'll find out won't we. 33 for stealth. All righty, and then make a perception check. Yeah. Natural 20. Okay. You glance up and over the side and from the low candlelit interior, which you watch as there's a small candle that's lit on a little wick there. And there's almost no furniture in this house whatsoever. There's a stool and you just see her sitting on the stool, motionless.",LIAM: I want to insight check and just get as good
Investigation,"down there pretty late. Well first I drag Keyleth off to the cozy little bathtubs that they have here in the castle and took the opportunity-- they're quite small, actually. And washed all of the caked-in, the last of the caked-in blood and everything. Because they say it, it's true. We have a full Roman sauna underneath, but that's fine, whatever you need. I took JB back and we built a fort in the room. And you've gone to bed? Oh yeah, I'm asleep. I look for a book on werewolves.","MATT: Okay, make an investigation check."
Perception,"You watch her get a little thousand-yard stare for a second, thinking. Her eyes are darting around a little bit and her brain is just running and running. ""All right. Well, unfortunately, I ""can't leave until tomorrow, I can only really transport myself once a day, but I'll immediately ""make my way to Vasselheim. That would hopefully be able to clarify some of these questions."" Do you need company? ""No, I can travel faster on my own."" All right. ""Besides, I can always go ahead and bring a friend."" How is Kima?","MATT: Make a perception check, actually."
Investigation,"Oh my god, did Hilda do something? You can see the sheet is missing. Most of his personal belongings are gone. Doty is still there. And Doty appears to be shut down, nonfunctional. Doty? Doty! Shit! The eyes are cold. Check the book! What book? Doty's book. Oh! I go look at Doty's book! It's within his chest compartment. I know. I helped build this thing. Can I figure out how to get the book to eject?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"any sign of Tary. That's so cocked. That's a natural 20. Okay. Not only do you find the latch, but you look underneath where one of the arms is. There appears to be a small glass bead, affixed with a piece of clay. And the bead has this pulsing blue light on it. And you notice it there, and it looks like it's the only thing with any sort of life on Doty's exterior. Does that look like part of Doty? It doesn't. It looks like something that was pressed onto him. Should we take it off? Is it magical?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Investigation,"Balls. Should we call everyone? Let's not call everyone. Who should we call? I don't know. Let's call everyone. Has anybody seen Tary? He's sleeping in, isn't he? He's not. Is he at the bakery? Wait, go check the bakery. Will someone go check the bakery? I'll check the bakery. Where are you? Do I see any trace of him?",MATT: Make an investigation check again.
Investigation,"Hilda is not there, no. I don't see anything here, Hilda's not here. The bakery looks normal? The bakery looks normal. Locked and closed, untouched since you left it the evening before. Wait, you think Doty's been boobytrapped? Look at that. That doesn't look normal. I want to a take a look at that and see if it looks like a trap, and I don't understand magic, but if it is similar to any trigger mechanisms that I've seen.",MATT: Make a investigation check.
Nature,"well. Westruun, and along the road of the Silver Cut. What was that thing you said? Turns field? There's the Turst Fields. And what was the other one? Jorenn Village. That's where you found Percy in prison. Okay. Where's the sun? Right now? It's close to noon. We'll finish this and I'll give it a few hours for the sun to go down so that I can actually figure out what direction the inn is facing.",MARISHA: And I couldn't try and do a nature check
Perception,"""she just asked a lot of questions."" And you've met us before? No? ""No. I've seen you around town. People talk about you, saying what you've ""done for the people..."" Do you bake cream puffs? ""I have before, yeah."" Do you want to work in a bakery? Just kidding. We were in the middle of something  we'll talk to you later!

Nature,"and focus on Taryon once more, your vision shifts and seem to be jettisoned across hundreds of miles within a second. No direction at the moment  it's too much of a blur of color and light and movement until it comes to a halt, and there you see Taryon, somewhat jostled by the spell kicking in and the momentum, you see him thrown over what appears to be the back of a horse, just (hoofbeats). Which way is the shadow of the horse? Taryon, you come to consciousness ever so slightly, and looking down, you see hooves clattering on the ground behind you. You glance around. Percival, I want you to go ahead and make",a nature check.
History,"you're heading more towards the city of Deastok, which is on the outskirts of the Dwendalian Empire. We did know that they were on a road headed west. Heading east. Which means if we head north and then the minute that we hit that main road start heading in that direction, we might even pass them on the way and be able to identify a horse. Especially if we're in like fart form. All right, so you guys are going into your Wind Walk form? Before we do. Percy, do you know anything about this country we're in? Anything?",MATT: Make a history check.

If you do talk, it comes out as (blows raspberry). (blows raspberry) There you go. What does it sound like if you laugh? (airy laughter) Sorry. We're going. As you guys continue pushing east... I'm going to be keeping an eye out for anybody on the road. Ditto.",MATT: Perception check from the two of you guys.
Stealth,"tall grass, bald? It's maybe knee-high grass with sections of bald. The landscape here, outside of the farmland and the forest that you can see, looks a little hard and badlands-ish. Scrubland. I'm going to go 200, 300 yards back towards the city, just in case they manage to get through. Okay. So you're getting down, you're doing that... I'm going to get into some grass, as close to the road as I can. I bamf Trinket out! And we get in the grass and stealth.",MATT: Okay. Roll a stealth check. Disadvantage for

It's a reliable talent, in fact.",TALIESIN: Stealth roll is-- oh that's not bad.
Perception,"There's no horse left. Yeah, oh boy. That's 30 points of damage. 30 points of damage! Is that a lot for a horse? That's my maximum damage with a single unaffected shot. Yeah, as the horse skids over and hits the ground, it falls onto its side, and you watch its heavy breathing become still. No! Dinner! I'm keeping a second shot. The second I see her head, I am taking a head shot on this girl.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check because you

Are you talking about what I think you are talking about? Yeah! You want to send her after your friend? Our friend. You think he wants a mercenary showing up in his life, looking for him? Think about it. He could be dead. He's doing what he wants to do. Did I overhear them?",MATT: Make a perception check.

I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on me and Trinket. And I'm going to send him down-- Is there a trapdoor or like a stairway around? That he can go down? There is a trapdoor that he can go down and then make his way. He's going to make his way down. But I am going to hide, at the top here, behind one of those-- Behind one of those? Okay.

Roll a stealth check.
Stealth,"I hit you with a ball of lightning, man, like a Tesla coil. I climb up to the top of the tower like, what's going on? (machine gun fire) At the start of your turn, you pick a creature to remain hidden from, not a general hiding. Oh, so I could say, I'm keeping hidden from Percy. Yep. But everybody else can still see you. And then I would roll for stealth to hide from everybody else? If you wanted to make the hide action.

Deception,"I couldn't get down to him, though? You could get right down to him. Oh, this is going to be the worst move ever if it doesn't work. I'm going to get down to where Grog is. This is so stupid, though! No, because if it doesn't work I can't get away! Because that's all my movement, isn't it? Let's team up, you and me. What are you doing? You want to team up? I go down to Grog and I say, let's shake on it. But I take my necklace off and I put it into my hand. Oh!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Stealth,"Oh yeah, that's part of this. So you could theoretically recover and come back. Yeah, if you roll a natural 20 on your death save. It's happened before. Fuck, okay. Those are my two attacks, so can I fly down to the ground behind the building... actually, they're all over on the other side. I'm going to drop down where I am. Okay. Drop down to the roof? Yeah, to the roof. And I'm going to lay down on the roof and use my bonus action to hide. Okay, you lay down on the roof, using your bonus action to hide.",Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Perception,"It's smart. (laughter) No longer Percy's turn. So with that, the braziers-- And Matt. Away from the things that blow up. Was that understood? Right, yes. And all the braziers flare up. Don't affect anybody. That brings us to Vex. I'm going to take off from the roof and try to make it to the opposite tower. The opposite tower, flying over here? Yeah. You make your way there. Can I see anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"As the brambles wrap around her, the flames burn them away. She's immune to being restrained. Yeah, I figured. I bet Tary's up here, but I don't know that. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. I was hidden at the beginning of the turn, but I'm assuming my movement took me out of hiding. Can I use my skirmisher's stealth to choose a quarry to stay hidden? Or I have to be hidden at the top of the turn? At this point, yeah. We're skirting a line, here, of watching you go up and land. You aren't amongst trees in a forest. It's easy to see where you are, vaguely. Okay, I'm going to hide.",MATT: Roll a stealth check.
Perception,"So 4d4 plus four. Gimme some squares. No, 4d4. I need some triangles. You also take six points of fire damage, reduced to three. Because you're doing this while on fire. Yeah. 4d4 plus four. 14 points. That's my turn. Okay, Grog's done. Keyleth? Okay. (grunts) Going to go ahead and drop my fire elemental form. It's looking pretty rough now. Hope I don't fuck that up. And I'm going to peek around the corner and I can see Vex a little up on the tower.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"I stayed over the roof. You stayed over the roof. You fall prone. You still take a point of bludgeoning damage, which is an immediate failed save, so you've lost one death save and you're unconscious there. And you're trapped up here with me. He'll go easy on you. Yeah, I'm sure. Kill me quickly so I can go pee, because I've had to for an hour now. That end your turn, Grog? Yes, it does. All righty. Keyleth. You don't know where anybody is. You're in acid water. I poke my head out. Do I see anything?",MATT: Perception check.
Insight,"Would I get out of the sphere of the electrical attack? Then no, I'll just stay there. Okay. You stay there. Go ahead and roll an attack for him. What do you think? Does he get a retaliation attack? No, if you're not moving, he doesn't. You're right. Never mind. All right, so bringing it back to Taryon. Never thought it would come to this.

I rolled pretty good, so it was 21 points of lightning damage, reduced to ten, and then halved because you have resistance, so five. Okay. And Grog, it's your turn. You have Keyleth over here.

There was some cash talked about, and also a place for my family to make a little bit of money or food. There's a farmhouse nearby our main estate. It's nothing special, a few acres of land.

We will fight for justice, and win battles against evildoers, and spread the Darrington name around the continent.

The badlands here, the sands of the deserts, the big storms largely don't make it into the center of the valley because the mountains protect it. While there are elements of it here and there, you can see the topography and the landscape here is very dried, cracked, red earth. Little moisture seems to be contained here.

There are small fissures from recent rains that caused the earth to well up and tear in places, and eventually the tracks curve in towards the mountain and end, and it's just sheer mountain.

If we go left, it's going to take us back the other way, so that's safe, but we could keep going straight where the light is. We're here for your friends, right? Yeah, they might still be alive. And I call out, hello? Okay. It echoes. ""Hello?"" Everyone make a",perception check.
Insight,"(hushed laughter) Will you go drinking with me some time? We'll see. By the way, I want you to know: when you died, I sang a song I would never sing for anyone else, and I'm sorry you didn't hear it, but it was really hard. Is that true? Yes. He sang? Yes. Do a truthful check. Do you know what he sang? A truthful check? Sure, I'll roll a truthful check.",MATT: An insight check? Okay.
Stealth,"kill them. (whispering) Can I murder one first? (whispering) Yes. (whispering) Thank you. (whispering) Wait, I shoot-- You're still inside the mansion. I thought she said the door was just barely open. Yeah, but they're not walking by  you made the door way back in the tunnel. You see them up toward the T-juncture. So you guys would have to leave the mansion and get there quickly. Shit. We sneak out. We sneak out and shoot them from behind.","MATT: All right, stealth check for those who are"
Investigation,"And I use a bonus action for an offhand attack. And I got a critical on it. I rolled a 20. You rolled a 20 on the second one? Okay. Roll damage on that. 76 for the first hit. Okay. In an instant-- don't worry about the second attack, critical damage. Both of them just go-- (footsteps) (thud) (laughter) What's in the box? What's in the box? You lift up the box-- We check it for traps.","MATT: Okay, investigation check."
Stealth,"Wait, hold on. Would you like this, either of you? It's not my bag. Gain a plus two bonus to attack... It's a weapon. All right, so what's the plan, guys? What are you doing? We should go. We should go attack things. Campfire! Well, let's go quietly, you and I, take point. And head deeper in, see where the people have been. Twins are in the lead.",MATT: New stealth checks from you guys since
Investigation,"for it! Yeah, you've got to juggle these balls. All righty. Sorry, Matt. What do we do? He's going to kill him! He's going to kill one of them! What should we do? Let's go! You move further into the tunnel. Twins in the lead, point, traps. All that. All right. Searching, keeping an eye out for any other people as well. All right, it's only 80 feet until the winding tunnel opens up slightly. So, make another","investigation check partway up, about halfway to"
Perception,"hallway. Well, if anything's going to bring more skeletons, it's that. Clicking my boots. I'm going to burn my quick heal. Might as well. What are you guys doing? Pushing forward, staying where you are? Should you heal us before we pop into anything more? Can you heal us? Yeah. I can heal us. That was a lot. That was a lot. I'm doing this.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"interior rock formations, and you can see a larger chamber beyond that. You have the right and left. I pop Trinket out. Okay. Trinket pops out of your necklace. What are you guys doing? Can I hear the noise of the ziggurat coming from either side more? You hear it coming from both sides. Let's split up. What about wind or anything? There's the general wind in the room, but it's (whoosh) whipping around you, picking up sand and dust from the ground. Do we see faces on either side?",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"to go, Matt, it's from your perspective. Well, do the best you can to see. The map's right. Towards and away from the ziggurat, and the ziggurat's 12:00 and we're 6:00. We'll just say leeward and windward. Starboard. Okay, so. There is a singular figure standing up here that seems to be giving orders and shouting it out to the side. Female voice rings out across the center of the chamber and says, ""Remnants, slay the intruders and grant their bodies to the cause!"" Can I see whose voice that was?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Deception,"rolling. All right, so at the beginning of this initiation, with the orb now flaring this pale gray-white and Delilah Briarwood standing there at the top of the ziggurat, staring down and focusing on the group of intruders that have just rushed in. Keyleth, it's your turn. Oh god. Okay. I am going to, under the cult hood that I have, transform my face with Alter Self into Sylas Briarwood. Okay. Her husband. Her dead husband. I'm going to have his face, and I'm going to walk forward and say, Delilah. Don't. It is me.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Investigation,"We did, because we had the mansion. You did. So by this conversation happening, the rummaging through the bodies, inspecting the vicinity, I'd say you maybe have 20 more minutes on your wings. Oh yeah, did we rummage through the bodies? Let's rummage through those bodies. You did, that's how you found the objects. While they rummage, Keyleth wants to test the radius. No, we found the objects on that cart. That's right, you found them on the cart. You did not actually rummage through the bodies. Is there anything on the bodies?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"and pull us out. Just earring us if something happens. Badger. Badgers burrow, right? Do badgers burrow? They do burrow. That's why I said stay, but that's all right! (laughs) All righty. So you guys all make your way back to the second entrance, the hidden, illusory one. You all back out of it, leaving just Pike and Grog on the inside. And we're helping them figure out where to punch to make everything-- Okay, cool. So I need you to go ahead and make",an investigation check.
Nature,"Immediate hot daylight hits you, the blaring sun of the Marquet sky. Clear blue sky, no clouds. You're now surrounded by a series of browned and leafless trees with these large canopies that have the same pear-like fruit hanging from the branches. Fruit? Fruit? Looks like fruit. Are you hungry? I'm hungry! Hold on. I hold up Pike to go grab some fruit. We'll check it! Don't worry, it's just fruit.",MATT: Make a nature check.
Investigation,"Want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate? I take out the jug and I go: honey! Hey! Oh, all right! Just a couple of sticky warriors. No, Grog! Just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud through, which coats your sticky hands with heavy desert sand. You chew for a minute and feel the crunch of granules inside your mouth where you inhaled. (crunching) Jug goes away. Back to you guys. You were looking for the other entrance? Yeah, up top.",MATT: Investigation check.
Investigation,"All right. How's it going down there? Have you found it yet? Up here? Yes. Fabulous. Our friend, Keyleth, is amazing. She jumped in, didn't she? Yes, she did. I'm going to Earth Glide to the bottom and then peek my earthy face out of the top, see if I can see down. Are you following the actual path? Yeah. I'll try to be conscious to make sure I don't hit anything that looks precarious.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"Yeah, you guys should try it. I pick up a piece of the local fruit and smell it. How do I describe the smell? It's reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that has grown sticky on a surface, like a dark mahogany wood surface. Kind of like a bar floor. We'll go with that. No, I don't think I will. It belies its true flavor. I don't think it does. This looks like it's rotten from the landscape. It looks like it's all gone bad. Has it gone bad?",MATT: Make a nature check.
History,"I'm rubbing off on you. Yeah. I don't know. Sleep on it. I'm going to go think. I have no idea what just happened. Yeah. I'm going to double-check the orb room just for a moment, for my own paranoia. The crisis orb room? Actually, I'll go with him. Just to look, and then I'm going to start researching that symbol. I'm going to go to the library and I'm showing the council everything. Okay. You speak with the rest of the standing chamber. You begin to do your research.",Make a history check.
Persuasion,"happened to Larry? ""Found a new occupation: chalice collector."" What am I going to do with all these chalices? ""Actually..."" Well, Larry. You know that these chalices are probably going to be used to save the world. ""That sounds like a perfect reason to buy them."" It does, doesn't it? And just think how wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone that you sell to that you sold the things that saved the world to Vox Machina.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"They're a bit hard to make, and they may just not be useful at all, but I thought... I don't know how any of this works. I'll see what I can do. Yeah. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Okay. You take the silver shot. Anyone want to try anything else? Yeah. I want to buy some holy oil, or get some holy oil from the church, or something. (laughter) Where do I get holy oil? From the church. We've gotten holy oil before. I just can't remember from where.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
History,"in the center of this circular-like city, the standing, ominous, commanding, massive spire of obsidian black, familiar to both of you through two different types of vision you've experienced. A jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred, encircled by dozens of dark, winged beasts that watch over the dreary skies. Who here is proficient in history? Nobody is proficient in history?! We're doomed to repeat it. Really, Percy? No, I have other qualities, history was not my forefront. I know Whitestone. Somewhere, Taryon is reading a history book.",MATT: Exactly. The two of you make history checks
Perception,"And the ziggurat is above us? There is no ziggurat. There is a large, black spire, but that's in the center of the city maybe two miles off. As we hop down, I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. There are buildings around, so are we in the middle of a field, a plain, badlands? There are buildings. You see two structures maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side, and then going forward, from your current position, it leads right into the city. So this structure is on the outskirts. It's right on the perimeter. Do we see any other orbs around?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"the signs of life that exist in this space, the movement you see of figures in the distance wandering through the streets, there's no immediate threat to this city, but you get the sense just looking out that something big happened here a long time ago. Any of you with the eyes, can you see what that is up in the air? Yeah, I also want to look and see what the fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving around in the city. But I want to see what kind of creatures are flying around as well. Okay, so you guys have moved down from the platform, and you cast Pass Without a Trace, so","I'd like everyone to make a stealth check, please."
Perception,"It's hard to tell at this distance. You're so far out of the city. You've only been able to notice a few shapes from this distance. You'd probably have to get in a little closer and spend some time watching their behavior to pick that up. I'm going to crouch down by this dead rodent. Do I sense the Queen, more or less, here? Make a wisdom check. 18. You close your eyes for a second. No. None. Can I pop my head back out the door, and looking at the ground, is there any semblance of a sewer system or a runoff grate or anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Performance,"Okay. All right. What do you guys do? I think we should probably try to observe the things that are flying around the tower. Slowly make our way to the town. Observe. Still try to avoid any of those scary creatures, but see if they avoid each other as we look at them. Super slow, super careful. Maybe we should stagger. No, those things were speedy. Be normal. We'll walk like this. Left, right, left, step, step, step. (laughter)",MATT: Make a performance check. No.
History,"blocks of the city, you see broken swords, you see pieces of armor, and you see figures walking through the street ahead of you. You see hundreds of scattered skeletons, decomposing bodies shambling through, but they all walk in patterns. They're not scattered, mindless. There is some will or direction to their movements. You see them wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on them that look old and tarnished and scratched. Are they moving like troops or is each individual following its own...? Some are moving as troops, and occasionally you see an individual wander off, but they're just sort of walking around and scanning. I'm going to","have Scanlan, you roll a history check, and Pike,"
Religion,"pieces of armor, and you see figures walking through the street ahead of you. You see hundreds of scattered skeletons, decomposing bodies shambling through, but they all walk in patterns.

Some are moving as troops, and occasionally you see an individual wander off, but they're just sort of walking around and scanning. I'm going to have Scanlan, you roll a history check, and Pike,",roll a religion check.
Perception,"Do we recognize them? No, not yet. Never seen anything like it? You have not seen anything like these before. Black as night against the gray sky. From this distance, you make out no details in their bodies. It's almost like a moving shadow above you. Wherever light would hit to give you some sense of structure, it's just absence, void. It's just a flying shadow. Are there any buildings that have enough structure to them where it feels like there might be things inside that have been relatively unmolested at this point?",MATT: Possibly. Make a perception check.
Athletics,"as he turns around, out of one of the cracks in the stonework nearby, you can see some dry, grass-like gray brush. There is what appears to be some faint hints of local plant life, but it all looks like gray, dry grass. Or, you know after a morning freeze, when you see elements of a field that have that weird, textured, almost water plant look to it? It's clusters of that, but curled. And one of those whips out with this one, long, grayish, almost fleshy-looking vine that wraps around it and yanks it inside the house. (grunt) Gets yanked in. Grog, you catch him. Cover his mouth. Like clockwork.","MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check, Grog."
Stealth,"Excellent. Can he still talk? Yeah, when I take my hand off his mouth. This thing will allow him to talk. I believe this thing has a... It has a little slit that you can remove to the side. It's got a gimp hole? All good magical items do, Liam. That's what you call an artifact. I give him a second to sit and I wait until we're all inside. Okay. You guys both attacked. Pull the bodies inside.","MATT: First make a stealth check, because you both"
Intimidation,"going to have a conversation. Given where you are, the circumstances that we find you in, I'm going to let you know that there is a curse upon my weapon, and the souls that are killed with this weapon are claimed by a demon named Orthax. Now, I haven't experimented as to what happens when somebody's soul is claimed by more than one creature, but I'm excited to find out. So wouldn't it be interesting if everything you've been promised here is suddenly null and void? So, yes, we may threaten your life, but I want you to know that what's really at stake here is just precisely what's left of your soul, so answer with caution. And I unlock.",MATT: Roll an intimidation check.
Investigation,"Yes, and that is the same symbol. It is, okay. We're in an ancient city. Are there the remains of furniture in here? I just want to take a nap or a cozy sit-down. No, I want to shove him in a closet or wrap him up in something. I'm putting him in the Bag of Holding as you're talking. We can't keep everything. Does anybody see any-- Never mind. Is there anything of interest in this building, since we have a moment?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"one or two swoop down and land on a distant rooftop, and you hear the crunching of heavy stone and whatever materials were still remaining on the roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a bit, and then (whoosh) takes off and joins the rest of its kin. Do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance. Either the building itself is slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness? I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Medicine,"We've seen long-dead people. This is fucking creepy in the upside-down. (airplane noise) What's going on? I called the airport to try and coordinate this time with you guys. Cost me 17,000 dollars for that one five-second bit, so enjoy it, guys. Worth it. Totally worth it. These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older? More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are? You would have to get up close and that",would be a medicine check. Would you want to try
Medicine,"Totally worth it. These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older? More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are? You would have to get up close and that would be a medicine check. Would you want to try and make your way close enough to one of these bodies to inspect it enough? How far off are they? If you guys continue moving forward, you'll be at that intersection in about 30 seconds. I'm not going to go. I'll wait. I could go up close with somebody and do a",medicine check.
Stealth,"begin to (footsteps). Can I just waft some of the smoke towards them? Shamble in your direction. The rest of the group noticing-- You begin blowing the censer smoke that way. You watch as three of the closest skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to vaguely lose interest for a brief moment. Since we're close, can I do a medicine check? Are we close enough to? Yes, but with disadvantage because of the smoke. Oh, shit. Okay. You got this, Pike.",TALIESIN: Roll like it's a stealth roll.
Perception,"(laughing) So. In the billowing smoke that's coming around, Grog, because you brought it up, as well as the twins who have relatively high passive perceptions, and Keyleth as well, actually, you glance up and notice that the erratic patterns that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky, there's two that seem to be circling, and circling. I don't like it, I don't like it. One of them (shrieks), and you watch as it goes into a dive in your direction. Oh, God! In our direction? Is there a building we can duck into?",MATT: Make a quick perception check.
Investigation,"swords to barricade the front windows or holes, I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam the door shut. Are there dark corners that anybody could be hiding in, or another room? The room itself is pretty damn dark. The little bit of light that comes in through the distant, broken elements of the wall, there's enough light where you can kind of-- it's very dim light for you, Percy. Everyone else with Darkvision is all right to make out the interior. Cursory trap check, even though it seems unlikely.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"side, but did not seem to cover both ends before they fell within this building. Let's get out of here. We should go out the other door as fast as possible. I'll take care of that barricade. But quietly. We don't want them to know that we're getting out the other side. I don't know if I can guarantee that. What are you doing, Grog? Moving shit out of the way of the door, in a... Medium pace? Let's call it a medium well.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Stealth,"the undead wandered towards that illusion, some are still on the other side, and now that you've pulled the censer back from it, the other door's kind of (bangs) coming pushed in. You can see light peeking through. You guys rush out, still with your Seeming illusion on, and you hear, very loudly, almost omnipresent, the screech, the (shriek) of the gloom stalker, right around the corner from you, as it begins to take off just on the other side of the building. Should we look for another building we can duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us? Yeah, we can just go hopping from building to building.","MATT: I want everyone to roll a stealth check,"
Perception,"So you guys rush past and, quick glance around, you find one of the nearby buildings. It's a little more dilapidated, but it seems to have at least enough cover where you can all dive into the shadows and seemingly vanish. You all stand there for a second, and you're super quiet, all breathing heavily (panting), the censer still billowing this awful, awful fume. It's filling your nose, your eyes are watering instinctually from the presence. It stings just to get into your sinuses, but you're all enduring it and trying to be as quiet as possible. Is there another door in this building that we can exit out?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Medicine,"out is the same way you came in. Fuck. Unless you climb up and out. But as you open the censer and look inside, it looks like there is this ember, this cluster of burning, dried herbs. You're not quite sure what it is or where it came from, but it's currently glowing red in places. I'm going to give some of the herbs to Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal? It has what looks to be charcoal stones in the bottom clustered around, and these herbs are placed over it, and it's burning and smoldering over time. Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are?","MATT: Make a medicine check. No, this would be a"

Perception,"mean, because it was a really smart plan. It worked for a bit. Not every plan is going to hold you to the very end. There was some cleverness to it. So you begin to move through these buildings before-- It would be Keyleth, Vex and Vax. You guys come around one small alley and it opens up into another main road, and this road's hard to avoid. It seems to be almost a circular central road that marks the outer and inner rings of Thar Amphala. But you see there, marking right across this road, a 15 foot tall wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of the town. How thick does it appear to be?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"You could always get swallowed. By Mr. Mistoffelees? By anything. I get the distinct impression we're going to have options before this day is over. I feel like we're going to have to do a lot of things to stop this. We need to get into the tower! We don't even know how to do that! We don't know what we're talking about, which is why I think the idea to go scope it out is a good one. Does it look like there's any windows on the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Intimidation,"on our world, why don't we just burn the whole fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy their weapons! I am excited by this plan. Wait, what? No! That's terrible! Let's burn down Manhattan. How do you do that?! Shall we ask this gentleman some questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand. Obviously, you're like really cool with the purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Investigation,"opens and his hands go limp and then (face exploding) and it just (splattering). Grog! Spray on Pike. I thought you were me giving the signal like, end it! No! I was going to-- whatever. All right. We'll work on it. We'll find another one. It's okay. Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Brains! Pike got Dragon Aged. Yeah! Is there a water bucket around?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"Oh my god. I forget, and then I remember to do it, and then we're already on the air. Indeed, we are. Welcome back, everybody. First off, our winner of the hero case from our friends at Wyrmwood is Rory1177. Rory1177, you are the winner for tonight. Congratulations. Denobo will contact you and get your information and have that shipped off to you asap, so congratulations. All right, so as the rest of you are taking a short rest, the two of you are making your way, as stealthily as you can, on the back of a gloom stalker as it encircles the exterior of the Castle Entropis. First off, I would like you both to make",a stealth check.
Perception,"I squeeze the gnome tighter. Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you don't get the plus ten anymore. That's okayish. 21. You have advantage, though, on everything. He's fine. 34. A low 34. Okay, so you guys begin to circle the exterior of the tower, making a wide spiral along its exterior. You make your way up. It's hard to gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I","want you both to make perception checks, please."

You make your way up. It's hard to gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I want you both to make perception checks, please. Now that we're closer, I'm looking for windows that she might not have been close enough to see. Doors, holes, anything.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse of energy, 20-something hooded figures just dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit blasted through us. Can I run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different? I join Vex. You guys rush out and peek outside of the doorway towards the top of Entropis. You see that the glowing pulse is gone. The energy tethers from the siphons are gone. Fuck. I look around. Are we still in the Shadowfell?",MATT: Perception check.
Deception,"Hoods forward. One of them, who appears to be a younger man, probably 18, 19 or so, who's got this little patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a little malnourished. He still has both eyes. He rushes up real fast, his hood pulling back a little bit, and he's looking around, excited but also with trepidation. ""So it's happening, huh? It's really happening!"" I guess so. It's fucking wild. So exciting. I'm so excited to be here! Oh, don't.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"I think he bought it. I think we played it really cool there, guys. I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for this long. So are we close enough now that we can start this? Not yet. You're about maybe 1,000 feet or so away. I'm going to see if there's any structures that are within distance so that once they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we can perch. We only need to be so far out. We can cover you from a roof.","MATT: Perception check, Percival."
Nature,"We're getting ready to teleport. And you watch as that creeping brightness forms a dome over your space, and then comes to a close over the top of the tower, and where once there was this gloomy skyscape, you now see what appears to be a brighter, clouded sky. The temperature grows a little colder, and you begin to see snowfall. Gentle snow begins to fall, and you watch as some of the cultists surrounding start reaching up and catching it in their hands. Now, now! We've still got to attack. It's totally taken us to Whitestone. It's okay, we can still kill everybody.",MATT: Make a nature check.
Intimidation,"Okay. Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself. Your cloak tears around your body, Incredible Hulk style as your form ruins what remains of the black, sheared fabric that once, even by the stretch of the imagination, pseudo-hid you, now... A bib remains. Exactly. It's almost like one of those Chippendale neckpieces. What you see is a number of cultists that were running away from the tower stop and see this, and then, almost instinctually,",go to defend. Make an intimidation check.
Athletics,"Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this? Yeah. Can I use my action to pick up my buddy Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as I can towards where Vex's body is laying. Okay, so you're going to pick her up and move? There's no difference, right? You can pick her up and move and then throw her to give her the most distance, but you can only move half your speed as you're carrying her. It's essentially an agreed-upon grapple. You'd be able to move 25 feet with her. Versus picking her up and throwing her for","an athletics check, or something?"
Athletics,"Yeah. I can make it to her. The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right now. I should just go unload? Yeah, do your thing. I would like to rage. You are raging. Can I use my full speed to head towards Delilah? (counting) That's as far as you can get right there. With my bonus action, can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I want to get within melee.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check."
Perception,"worry. Four. Grog, you vanish. (groaning) Banished from this realm of existence. No! You appear on the ground in the Shadowfell, in the gaping crater where Thar Amphala once stood. You look around, up to the familiar cloudy, dark sky, and are alone. Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell anymore? No. Oh, right. Snow's falling. Wildemount, or some shit.","TRAVIS: Without a perception check, is anybody"
Perception,"Oh, right. Snow's falling. Wildemount, or some shit. Without a perception check, is anybody around, or is it just me? Nobody's around you, although you do look up and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers, swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet. God fucking damn it. You've been banished to another dimension. You can punch your way out of it. You know what? I only have one thought. Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards, y'all. He's going to turn to those cards. We've got this.","MATT: Keyleth, perception check."
Perception,"Without a perception check, is anybody around, or is it just me? Nobody's around you, although you do look up and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers, swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet. God fucking damn it. You've been banished to another dimension. You can punch your way out of it. You know what? I only have one thought. Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards, y'all. He's going to turn to those cards. We've got this. Keyleth, perception check. What?",MATT: Perception check.
Stealth,"Just the one. Just the one Power Word Kill. The fact that he's not a god gives me diarrhea feelings. Okay. All right, and he's going to move back a bit, frustrated at the-- At everything. At your attempts to Counterspell. Actually, no. He laughed at that. ""Nice try."" It wasn't my best performance. All right, that's going to end his turn. Delilah's out. Grog. (laughs)",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Arcana,"see the face, the eye which just looks upward at nothing, the dead body still, the eye twitches and shifts to look at you. Oh! (unhappy humming) Her fucking eye is still moving. Should we take it out? Yes. It could be Vecna, watching us. Does it look reptilian? Can you put it in a bag or something? Cover it up? Wait, can I take a closer look at it and see if I can, I don't know, identify it somehow? Do you have an Identify spell? No, but can I just see?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Athletics,"Briarwood, the eye shifts back towards you. The closer you get, you watch as the thinning slit of the pupil seems to widen and focus on you. It's an unsettling presence. As you try and concentrate to see if there's any immediate signs of whether it be sigils or arcane marks that would mark it to be more of a magically enchanted object than an actual organic eye, nothing comes to mind other than the fact that it seems to be very intent on studying you back. Can I try to remove it from the ocular cavity? Using your fingers? Yeah. My tiny, ocular hands.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Athletics,"every person that's ever mattered to you, you've seen slain before you or heard about. You could stop that from ever happening again. All the answers you could have. You would have the power to prevent any of that from ever happening again. And it's so simple. It's so simple! Could we smack the eye out of his hand? As this is happening, you watch as he's looking at it and this hand goes up and starts clawing into his own eye socket. I'm going to use every dex I have. I'm going to slap fucking hard. Dex isn't going to help you so much as it's going to be a strength thing. Go ahead and make an","athletics check. For you, for this, this would be"
Athletics,"Athletics. Oh, athletics, that's better. You're trying to slap it out of his grasp. 13. 10. You slap and the hand pulls back a little bit and he yanks it back. You can see a trail of blood beginning to pool out of the corner of the eye. Can I try to grab his hand and slap him across the face? Yeah. This is the last chance anybody has to try and do this or Scanlan loses an eye. We're going into Event Horizon moment, here. Go ahead",and make an athletics check.

Investigation,"What? (louder) Can you make the mist go away? I don't know. Can you try? I half-heartedly do a Gust cantrip while still sitting next to Vex. You watch as some of the mist dissipates and very quickly begins to roll back. The mist here is almost aggressive in its need to fill the space. Like a lot of things in the Feywild, it almost has its own sense of nature and purpose. It's not going to let someone push itself back if it wishes to exist on the forest floor. As you're rushing in to help, because you've already made the","investigation check and the mist is rolling in,"

Nature,"come to you so you can make me disappear and come back? No! The eye! I can get rid of the eye! No, it makes me nervous, Scanlan. I want to keep our... eyes on it. (laughter) Fuck off! Maybe we should vote on this. Should we give it to me? Who says aye? You can buy my vote. I don't have that much. Yes, you do. You can buy my vote. I don't have enough. Are there any animals around?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"Yeah. How long does he have to rest so he's not exhausted? Long rest. These are all long rests. We're all getting long rests. I'll take second watch. I'm already exhausted. I frenzied last. Yeah, so if you don't rest, you don't get rid of that point of exhaustion. We've all learned what happens when I get two points of exhaustion. Good things. Vecna comes back, and we all die. Vecna is back. All right, so Percival, second watch?",Perception check.

I run down from the tree. It's Powder from the movie Powder. Wait! Vax? I don't know. I'm asleep. We're asleep? You crawl down. What the fuck? I don't want him to see me.",MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.
Insight,"It's a trick! It's a trick. It's a trick of the Feywild. I'm sorry I'm naked. Come here. I'm all right. He's physical. He's cold. But he's there. How are you here? I don't know. I died. I know. I didn't see it. I died, too. But you're back. So are you. I'm so glad you're back. Don't cry. I have your armor, and Keyleth-- are you all right? Are you really here? Yeah, I'm really here.",LAURA: Can I roll an insight check to make sure
Medicine,"20? Right as you've known your brother, there doesn't seem to be anything that tells you otherwise. Vax? Can I put my hand on his chest and see if I feel a heartbeat? Now as you notice, now that you've lost focus from the fact that he's there, you can see where previously, there was a small, darkened spot on his chest that looked like a bruise of some kind that never quite went away, it has expanded a bit to be almost in the shape of wings across the front of the chest. Do I feel a heartbeat?",MATT: You listen closely. Make a medicine check.
Medicine,"I cannot wait for you both to be angry with me later. Okay. Does he feel cold? Colder than you remember, yeah. Oh god, he's undead. Is it you? I thought I killed you. You? I could have done more. No. Nobody could have done more for me. No. You're cold. Am I? I probably should put some clothes on, then. I put my ear up to his chest.",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Performance,"We can't do this alone. What about Artagan? That's his name, right? That's a start. Who? Artagan. The guy who messed with us for three days? Yeah, but he was really powerful. Oh, yeah. He was. I bet if we call the werewolves, he will show up, as well. I'll just howl for them real quick. It's not like we can stop you. True. (howls)",MATT: Make a performance check.
Religion,"favors. We are going to owe our lives. We are going to lose. Are we really going to pledge allegiance to a bunch of different gods? That's what we're going to do? That could be cool. We'll see. Do we each get different suits, matching suits, but in different colors? God powers? No, you're taking it too-- relax a little. Do you want some ale? Like Captain Planet? Who's your god going to be? Is there a god of mischief or song or cubes?",MATT: Make a religion check.

Perception,"And with a singular howl, you all shift out of the Feywild and then rapidly appear right on the outskirts of the outer wall of Vasselheim. You see the large, almost Sumerian-looking structures and walls that surround the outside. The ancient architecture of the place definitely has the oldest look, and you remember seeing it from the top when you flew in through your first skyship arrival into Vasselheim. The snow-covered ground and snow-covered trees as part of the Vesper Timberland. I immediately look around in a 360, very quickly. Does there look like any big cities that should not be here?",MATT: You can make a perception check.
Survival,"Okay. That's two Greater Restorations. The memory returns to you of the Feywild. (gasps) Oh, I don't have to pee. (laughter) This makes me wonder if you've been doing it wrong this whole time. It's whenever he remembers. Vax. You feel this small, pounding headache in your head. It's a very faint burn. I actually have this. Yeah. You shake your head, and it changes in your head, based on where you're facing. What? Duskmeadow?",MATT: No. It's... make a survival check to try and

You mean the old scroll? Yes, the old scroll Contact, where she gets to the beach and her dad is there? That's what it felt like! Wow! I need to go back there! Let's all go! Hang on. Do other gods live there?",MATT: Make a religion check.
Deception,"up the middle, there's one that looks to be a captain of some kind and this one to his right who's dressed in standard guard gear looks like he's got a few long-healed scars and he goes, ""That looks just like him."" Oh no. What did you do? What did you do? You were with him as Tary! I wasn't there! (laughter) The one in adorned armor. ""Sir, might I have your name and purpose here in Vasselheim?"" (high-pitched) Peter Frostbucket! I seek Lord of the Quad Roads!",MATT: (giggling) Make a deception check with
Deception,"small office by the gates. The captain-looking individual goes, ""Right, Mr. Frostbucket. We would like the both of you to ""please come with us."" The two guards rush into your flank a bit and place their hands on your shoulder and your shoulder. Me? I just met this man. I've never seen him before in my life. ""You've been walking with him for 20 minutes."" Thank you for coming over here. He was holding me hostage. He wouldn't let me leave. I'm a small man. I'm defenseless, and he was holding me captive.",MATT: You make a deception check.
Intimidation,"around us to die or be scared! All right! Is there a leader? Yeah, there's the captain. The one that looks scared looks over and says, ""Is your other friend around? The other big one?"" Kind of blanched complexion, orange hair? ""Yeah with the--"" Hits people in the face? ""That one."" Somewhere around here. Turns to the guard captain and goes, ""There's another one around here. Possibly two."" You know, the thing about that one, though, he doesn't like to leave loose ends.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Deception,"The guard captain there, immediately seeing this, reaches back and pulls a horn off his belt. (horn blows) I'm going to kill him. Don't kill him. We'll all die! I reach up and snap the horn. (horn blows, cracking) Horns make him angrier! And I'll make the image go crazy with rage. Angrily starts stomping around, not affecting anything directly. The only way to calm it down is if we slowly walk away in different directions. (laughter)",MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage.
Perception,"vanishes immediately, and all of the guards that are rushing up stop, see this happening, and start switching over to their various crossbows and ranged implements. Sure. Yeah. I've got nothing. Literally, that escalated quickly. All right, so a bunch of shots trying to be taken at both of you. I'm going to say six to each from the crossbows. What's the giant eagle's AC, Marisha? Oh gosh, you are keeper of the giant eagle AC. Is the giant eagle small enough to Dimension Door? Nope.",MATT: I rolled a perception check for that one
Investigation,"you're getting further out of the range of any sort of ranged weaponry to be immediately effective, but you don't know how long before other, bigger guns are brought into the fray. What are you going to do? You look down over the whole Quad Roads and you can now see, the whole city of Vasselheim almost looks like a top-heavy X with the mountain range at the top. The Quad Roads is where that X meets at the base. What are you doing? Oh, you can't talk. Shit. Land us in an alley somewhere, and we'll change our appearance, I suppose. (squawks)",MATT: Make an investigation check. What's the
Perception,"sky? The sky is gently dappled with faint wisps of cloud and is blue and beautiful, but you do not see a particular sun in the sky. Though the light seems to be ever-present, what faint shadows you see seem to be almost from multi-directional light. There is no actual sun in the sky that you can see. The light appears ever-present. Strange. Wow, Grog. Ow. I'm going to keep an eye out, see if there's any movement in the fields while he's attuning his armor.","MATT: Perception check, please."

Occasionally, these stone structures resemble figures of old ancient figureheads from the Age of Arcanum, who bore the embrace of the Everlight with them before her following fell from grace. You can see the ravages of time and the diminishing of her influence following the Divergence are shown on some of these figures as they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in places. But still, no sign of anything else moving on the island. Does it look like people are avoiding us or does it look like this is not a place of--",MATT: Make a perception check.

Does it look like people are avoiding us or does it look like this is not a place of-- Make a perception check. All right. I had a funny feeling you would say that. 12. You see no signs of any movement, any foot tracks. No signs of anything in the vicinity that would lead you to believe that you're being avoided or being watched. Does it look like anyone has been here for a very long time?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"more, you find yourself standing in the deep center of some vast orchard, surrounded by an endless sea of fruit-bearing trees of all sizes, shapes and colors, intertwined, the canopy broken and sparse in places where you can see above a clear, blue, cloudless sky. You're no longer on the Island of Renewal, that's for sure. Oh, I thought, but isn't that where the Dawnfather is? Island of Renewal is where Sarenrae is. The blessed fields of Elysium is the plane. He existed elsewhere in there. I understand now. Is there the same ever-light sky?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Nature,"I fly up next to Keyleth so I can see. Wow. Do you think this is like Sarenrae, where we can't get to him unless we have him in our heart? You know, I feel a little bit more connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm surrounded by trees. This I can relate to. I mean, I've tried to talk to Pelor before. I've talked to the Sun Tree. (gasps) I wonder if the Sun Tree is here? Maybe he's got a twin here like you have a twin! Maybe. Do I recognize any of the fruit that's growing on the trees?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Investigation,"long ago when he had a thing for Sarenrae, and that was pretty bittersweet so he's staring off into space. Okay. One piece of fruit? One piece, just one little piece. An apple. No. We're in Elysium! Oh my god, please. If you do eat anything, and you shouldn't, but if you do eat anything, eat something you don't recognize, it'll be funnier that way. Is there any fruit that I don't recognize?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"relative of the Sun Tree. Maybe I know him by proxy. Maybe they're like, oh yeah, Sun Tree I remember him, he got taken away as a seedling, but he was really great. How's he doing? I mean, you know you want to. It's an Elysium tree, just saying. Maybe they don't even speak our language. It's possible. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, Kiki. I'll try and speak to one of the Sun Trees that looks the most friendly. (laughing) Amicable tree.",MATT: Make a nature check. See which one seems the

You're pretty Whitestone blinged. We're Vox Machina. We were sent here to speak to Pelor by the goddess Sarenrae. ""Sarenrae sent you?"" Yes, she did. ""With what business?"" To speak about a very big evil growing on the Material Plane.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Athletics,"cut off from Vex. I was running up the wall. I didn't make it in time? Not at your speed, no. It's a big chamber. Okay, I'm going to haste, as fast as I can. When I clicked my boots, do I still get a hasted action? Yes, you do. Okay, cool, then I can go 160 feet. Yes, you can. The planar is still holding on to the back of your head, it's going to make another strength check. I'm going to try to tail whip him. Is that a thing I can do?",MATT: Make an athletics check.

He's on my back, or he's like hanging onto me? He's on your neck and head. He's holding on and trying to steer you off to the side by controlling your movement.

You have the guards behind you, the large planetar and deva entities that stand there, armored in their golden plate, after ushering you out, are standing guard. Maybe we can ask them. Sure.

That way, I can keep an eye out for the forest next, too, and the house and all the things we're looking for. I got a good look at the map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well. Right.

I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles.

For you to really super track with advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form. Not so much tracking right now, just a loose passover as we're going, looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot.",MATT: I'd say make an investigation check.

Okay. So all of you land and follow Vex? Yeah! You all take a minute to go back to your physical forms. You glance over, and there it is, standing before you.

Investigation,"another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of the stonework, like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house. It holds the weight of this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step. Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good Rube Goldberg. I was really excited by this thing. It's a shame to dismantle it. It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we can crash it down. Does the door look hinky at all?",MATT: Make an investigation check.

Could we trouble you just for a few moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to talk to you. We've come a very long way... as farts. That's got to count for something.

And try and jump around the fire, dragging him away from the fire.","MATT: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics"
Investigation,"Tidal Wave to quell the flames. The building is standing, mostly. The whole front of it is blackened. The flames are gone. Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling is ruined. The house is in shambles. What about the books? A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled out. The house is pretty wrecked. Can I go over to them and see if I can find some books I think Percy would like?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"so English may have changed. To be fair. To be fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would have thought it would be in one of those tomes. I'm going to pick up the book that he was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just try and read it. Okay. You glance through it. The book is a simple book, talking about the construction of barricades and it looks like it was less the contents of the book and more just the image of the book itself. I'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this is--",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

All right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down. We should maybe find Ioun, don't you think? If we must, yes. Just as an experiment, I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up and flip through it.",MATT: Make a religion check.
Perception,"and flip through it. Make a religion check. Nope. You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar one. There's a system. I will discover the system. I'm going to keep running around like a kid. What are the rest of you guys doing while Percival is running around like a kid? I'm not interested in the fucking books. Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans. Does anything in Primordial stick out?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since your arrival. I wonder if we could follow the glow. Warmer? Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there! All right. I run to where she's pointing. Is there any change in the glow? No noticeable change. Damn. Sprigg, stand over there! I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so give me a second.

We'll have to band together and go forward. Really? Yes. Where did you get the sunglasses from? It's glowing in here. The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint glow similar to the glow that you see emanating from Sprigg's torso. Is it glowing any more than--,MATT: Make a perception check.

It's cold, it's chilly, the wind that's blowing is very faint, but it's enough to the point where snow is falling. There is a very faint mist in the distance. Either a storm is coming or a storm has passed that's preventing you from seeing any sign of a glimmer of the smoke. So you're not entirely certain the direction. Can I tell if the storm is coming or the storm has passed?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"size isn't as large as you height-wise, but width is about matching yours, so this is a bowling ball of a goliath. Steps up on the top. (grunts) Only taller. A large Danny DeVito. Actually, yeah, that's a good point. But if Danny DeVito also was doing Iron Man competitions for a number of years and then let himself go, so he has the bulk of the muscle underneath but then-- Yeah.

Perception,"I can light up my flame hands. You're underwater. But it's magic. I thought it doesn't matter? I will say, you get a little bit there, and it's fighting against it.

Athletics,"the last time I talked about the Deathwalker's Ward, I'd set it to fire, so we'll say fire. Immune to or resistant to? Resistant to. Is my mantle helping with the heat? Yeah, the heat isn't bothering you as much. It helps with extreme heat as a general weather type, but intensely dangerous heat like fire or anything, it's not going to help you with that. So you dive into the center? Yeah, I forgot. He's like a crash test dummy. We'll worry about that later. You watch as Vax disappears into the liquid. The pressure is a lot. I need you to make an",athletics check first.

I know it's probably fuck-all, but I'm going to pull out the Flametongue Dagger and try to use it as a shitty-ass-- You can faintly see a little bit of it there. You do take three points of fire damage as soon as you enter the water, reduced to one. So you manage to push through and descend about 15 or so, 20 feet.

Athletics,"another athletics check, please, as you're pushing further and further down. Use my first Luck of the day. Oh, not good. Same thing. Just a six. A six? It begins to push you up, you lose a little bit of ground. You take another one point of fire damage. You begin to make up, and you get partway down. You get another 40 or so feet down into it, you think. Still unable to really see anything. Occasionally, you see a glint of that light that you saw before. The little bit of glow. You take another three points of fire damage, reduced to one. It is a lot of heat, but you continue to push further. Make another","athletics check, a third one."
Athletics,"16. Okay. You're slowing down a bit, but you're still getting ground. You also take another three points of fire damage. This is getting hard. Yeah? And even your form, you're getting a little tired, having to go against this force. And you're not quite sure where this is going to lead you. You're not going to stumble across an opening where it's fine to walk. You're continuing to swim down a superheated-- I'm going to push it just a little bit more.","MATT: Okay, make another athletics check."
Investigation,"it, let's look. We can walk the perimeter Let's do a little walk of the perimeter, and when we're ready, we're going to jump down and we'll Mary Poppins it. Okay, so you guys begin to make your way around, spiraling the outside of this. Looking, using the light. Okay, what are you looking for? I'm looking for other expelling gasses, interesting plant growth, lights. Anything that looks not-natural. Yeah, caves. Okay, everyone who's looking, make an",investigation check.
Stealth,"Vax, then Vex. Me in the middle. Grog. Is Trinket still swimming along with you? Trinket is behind Grog. All right. And then that's Scanlan and Keyleth at the very end. All right. You guys dive past under the water. It curves, and you can see there's a faint light source in the distance. This curves below. It splinters downward and then curves up slightly, and that's where the light source is coming from. Yeah, of course. Air pocket. I'm going to go stealth.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Athletics,"Oh fuck. Were there any other pockets of water along the way? Shit. Get back in the water. And I'm going to solo go where I wasn't intending to, to see how far it is to get to the next bit of water. You said it was a jump over magma? Yep. Does your creepy undead brain remember how long it takes before we die if we don't breathe? Do you remember that? I walk away from her, and I go down the hall. All right. It's a decent jump to get over the lava. It's not a hard one, necessarily, but I","want you to make an athletics check, anyway."
Athletics,"It's how I solve so many problems in my life. It's the solution to half our problems. We're going to try to water-bong every combat scenario for the rest of the campaign. I was looking at it, and I was like, fresh water, vinegar, oh! All righty. So. Don't do drugs, everyone. As you guys make your way around the way, through the combination of that druid spell and, strangely, Grog's ingenuity, you guys have bypassed a fairly serious situation. You make it down around the curvature of the tunnel, to where that small lava jump is. Anybody who wants to make","that leap, go ahead and make an athletics check,"
Athletics,"two feet of height as it collapses, and it's still blocking a large portion of that hallway right now. That's your first hit.

Yep, I'm going to (leaping noise) over the side, hardcore parkour. One-handed. Duke boys, sliding over the hood of the car? Using your boots, or just making an athletics check as part of your movement? Yeah, let's use the Boots of Feral Leaping.",MATT: Go ahead and make your athletics check.
Investigation,"That's a complicated tray. (laughter) As he herniates a disc. Yeah. I pulled my leg earlier this week, so moving up and down sucks. So as you sit there in the silence there for a moment, just hearing the occasional (plopping) with the nearby lava that fills the nearby hallway, you don't feel any further rumbling. There's just the heat emanating from the corpses of these three magma bullettes. What do you do? Can I look around for anything that resembles an anvil or a shelf or something that one might wackadoodle on?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Yeah. I pulled my leg earlier this week, so moving up and down sucks. So as you sit there in the silence there for a moment, just hearing the occasional (plopping) with the nearby lava that fills the nearby hallway, you don't feel any further rumbling. There's just the heat emanating from the corpses of these three magma bullettes. What do you do? Can I look around for anything that resembles an anvil or a shelf or something that one might wackadoodle on? Make an investigation check. Nice. Watch me knock this out of the park.",MATT: I'd say more of a perception check for
Religion,"This is the most irritated I've ever seen Matt. This is because of the planetar, not Ioun? Planetar. This is how you must stay always. I agree. Glancing at the glyphs here, there are roots of magical, arcane glyphs here, but whatever enchantment there was here is very faint. It's more about the message or image that is set here. It is an exit seal. It is a final word of those that utilized the space within. It translates to, ""Here the Crafter's Halls lay dark, the means of making the World Ender gone. Allhammer protect us all."" Allhammer. Wow. I don't know.",MATT: The Allhammer. Make a religion check.
Investigation,"and for the use of the Allhammer, and the Allhammer is locked somewhere on his own plane across the other side of the Divine Gate and has been for 800 years. We've got a god-made doorway in front of us. Something-made door, right. Natural rock around it or is everything carved? Natural volcanic rock. It's that same crumbly, porous black stone. I'm going to touch the doors. It feels like the rest of the surrounding stone. There's no obvious mechanism for opening it?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"glowing? No, the runes aren't glowing. You get the sense, Scanlan, that it was less that they were glowing, more that your truesight revealed the presence-- To me, everything is glowing a little bit. You are a little Neo in the Matrix in this new physical form. Tommy Wiseau is what I'm getting from this. I'm going to take the Sun Stone out of its little container, and really light up the room, and just illuminate the whole room now. Is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"I cannot wait to get to Halloween Horror Nights with you again. Travis Willingham's fatal flaw. I'm quick as hell. (laughs) You are quick. That's why we leave you ten feet ahead of us. You are the best jump scare. One of these days you're going to break someone's nose. I know. Ah! I'm so sorry! (laughter) It's going to be glorious. Anyway, as you descend the staircase, you ahead, make a",perception check.
Perception,"there is no light source below at this point... the stairs are continuing and continuing and continuing, and you have no idea how long it'll go for, but you begin to sense as you're walking, and you hear this faint rhythmic, bassy rumble of a low, nearly inaudible, drum-like beat, deeper than any sound you've heard, quaking the ground ever so faintly. (slow, rumbling pulses) And you can very faintly feel it. You get down and move your fingers to the ground, and for the moments before the heat gets there, the next time you hear it, you can feel a very faint vibration, only because you are very perceptive at the moment. Is it exactly rhythmic? Precisely?","MATT: I'd say, with your high perception check,"
Investigation,"side, some of them are attacking, some of them are defending, and about every 25 or 30 feet or so, there will be one on one side or the other. Are they standing free, or are they carved from the wall? No, they're from the wall. They're drawings? They're reliefs. They're metallic reliefs in the wall. Not some metal Medusa that turned them into metal? Made of the same metal, it looks like, as the walls around them. I'm going to quickly inspect one.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"also part of the relief embedded in the wall. Okay. And one open hand. One open hand. It's embedded in the wall, and the other one is open to the side. But the relief is all embedded in the wall, and you can see the triangular opening. The only thing that darts inward is that vacuous shape in the face. This is where Vox Machina dies because they can't figure out-- We can't figure out how the triangle works. Is there anything on the floor? Any patterns on the floor?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"no sneak attack, just kidding. Did you Hunter's Mark him? There's the Hunter's Mark. Five Hunter's Mark. That's the first attack, and the second attack at disadvantage is 19? 19 just misses. Hits the armor, (crash) shatters across it. Fuck. Is that your turn? Yeah. All right. Vax. All right, I want to slam down right-- Sorry, can I use my bonus to hide behind one of those pillars?","MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll a stealth check."
Investigation,"and destroyed on the ground. Whether it be drowned, torn apart internally, or bludgeoned in the center of their chest cavity, they are no longer moving. You still, now in the quiet, hear the rhythmic (steady banging) that's been perpetually feeding into the distant background of this entire structure deep beneath the volcano. What do you want to do? Can I look at the golem, the construct that's down by me? Is his face, the triangle face, is it detachable? Can I remove it from the rest of his person? We can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in.",MATT: Make an investigation check.

We can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in. Make an investigation check. Hold onto your butts. That's a one. There's no button for it. There's the old fashioned way. I'm going to land down next to the other one and start looking in the same fashion. Across the room.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"they were slowly catching, anyway  there's something about them, the heat that the general room perpetually emanates maintains the fires within. But your flame with the burning hands very quickly elevates and quickens that process, and you watch as the coals now glow to a bright orange-red hue, and you can feel the heat emanating from them. Can we turn the circle? Does it move? So you go up to the edge and you grab the edge of the golden crest and tug! And it's not moving. Gosh darn it! What are we supposed to do? Are there any inlays?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"12. It's smooth gold, there's no signs or runes or anything on the side. I want to see if there's anything in the holes that were left by the soldiers who left. What was that? The three suits of armor came out of the wall, so there's now a wall that we haven't seen behind them. Maybe it's supposed to be gold. Platinum is for the trammels. Okay. So you go ahead and look inside which one? I'm going to do all three, but I'll start on the one on the left.","MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check."

Stealth,"into place. You hear a heavy slamming sound and what sounds like the scraping of heavy chain mail. (metallic scraping) I grab the platinum pyramid and I put it in the Bag of Holding. No! I already said that I had them. No. No, he doesn't do that. The wall immediately shudders and you see a layer of dust and soot, (falling sand) off of it. as it falls to rest onto the ground and you see the wall slowly rise up. (grinding gears) Wait. I want to prep something. Hide! Okay, so who's hiding? I am.","MATT: All right, stealth check."
Perception,"is much louder now. You can sense that it is actually the source of that rhythmic beat, that metal-on-metal clang you have been feeling since you first came into this series of chambers. You can see small streams of glowing orange molten rock within the chamber, which is slightly down and before you. Looks like two small ten-foot-wide rivers of molten rock, metal-- you can't quite tell from here, but it's glowing orange and red, and they both convene and go dark in the center where it looks like they are being covered or obscured by something that you can't quite make out at this distance. A giant anvil?","MATT: Make a perception check, anybody who wants"
Perception,"Well, you know, it's like a whole thing. Can I get another quick re-rundown of the room? So he was up at the top of the stairs, facing out, not moving and was that wall behind him, or does it go further past him at all? I'd say about 15 feet behind him you can see the occasional reflection of the flashes of light, where it looks to be there is a wall behind him. There is an end to the chamber, but you're too far away and it's too obscured by smoke for you to know exactly what's behind him. And when I got in there, I didn't get close enough to see if there was any good hiding spots beyond him?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Arcana,"Heal 13 points. All righty. So as you continue to step up the stairs. Grog, as you approach, you get about a third of the way up there and you hear what sounds like heavy metal scraping against stone and one giant burst of sound. You watch as the giant figure shifts and turns back out of the smoke, holding across its front in one hand a large cleaver-like blade with runes glowing across the side of it. About 15 feet or so from end to end, and as it spins, it looks down towards you all and holds it in front, the flat end facing out towards you in a ceremonial way. What kind of runes?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Perception,"of damage. What if you go and try to pick up that hammer first? Do you need it? I'm picturing the anvil right in front of me and he's off to the side, right? The anvil is right in front of you. He's on the other side of the anvil. You only see the upper part of the torso because he's standing off the platform below it. So you see him from the waist up  he's about 20 feet tall from top to bottom, you only see ten feet of his torso there. The blade's out in front. And the hammer is somewhere between me and him?",MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check to see if you
Perception,"There's four chains on each side that are dangling off the side, and you are not sure which one it is. Oh, it went hanging off. It went held off the side, so now there are four chains that are taut on each side of the anvil that are vanishing. Is he another golem? It looks to be a golem-like construct, yeah. You have seen golems and you have encountered golems before, and the constructs of them can vary. This one, elements of it have the same proportions of a golem, but there are elements that seem more human-like as opposed to an armored battering ram. The refined details of it-- no,",your perception roll isn't high enough and you're
Arcana,"Is his sword as big as our table is across? Oh, what if we show him one of our little beans? Well, I pulled mine out. Maybe you have to show him how good a blacksmith you are to earn the privilege. Yeah, but I've got to get to the anvil to do that. Yeah, the blade in his hand, just the blade from hilt to end is about 15 feet long. Scanlan, can you read the arcane runes on his sword? Do you know what this enchantment is? I can certainly try.","MATT: Make an arcana check, Scanlan, as you glance"
Perception,"on? The chains are immediately to the left and right of the anvil, so to go towards the chain you'd be stepping closer to the anvil, and as you turn to the side its head tracks you as you go. Is it tilting it down? You haven't moved forward, so no. Okay. Can I keep moving in that direction? Okay, you begin to step forward towards the chain. The blade comes down to a flat end towards you. I'll stop. I'm going to try and sneak around the side of it. What's behind it?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"quick little heal bonus going, because why not. Let's do a heal. So that's 14 points up, so I'm 156. A little bit better, and that's my heal. I'm noticing that this thing's only taking magic damage. The hammer it dropped is underneath the planetar right now, right? It is currently dangling off the side, along tongs and other smaller blacksmithing accoutrements. I'm going to run in that direction. Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20. Another step, and you're starting to hit the molten metal and rock. Molten metal and rock? I can't jump that, can I?","MATT: You can try, yeah. Make an athletics check."

Arcana,"you let go of the chain, you'll land. If you hold onto it you'll dangle and swing in the center. This is the hammer chain? Yeah. So am I touching the hammer right now? But it's not a magic hammer, it's just a really nice hammer. You just grabbed it. You can take a moment to look at it next round, if you want to. Yeah, I'm going to take a moment to look at it. I've got an action, still. Do you want to do that, then? Yeah, I'll use my action to admire the hammer.",MATT: Okay. Make a arcana check. As you're
Perception,"to do something, like an attack, you can only do that because it's a reaction, a very quick thing. Basically, as soon as you get your vision you're like, (panting). I will rage, and that's it. I'll let you rage on that, sure. Can he attack the elemental that's now rogue across from him? He's not within range, unfortunately. It's across the way. Can I turn around and look, now that I'm right up next to the Core Anvil, is there anything that I'm noticing about it that would move or knock off? A switch or a button?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"Well, let's give it a shot. Bigby's Hand moves over here. Oh, he's dead! He's dead, Matt. Game over. If we go by that tactic, Bigby's Hand's dead. You've all died. I'll put him there. Percival has been dead for a long time. We'll put that there. That's good. There you go. All right. I want to try to move Bigby's Hand to hold on to his arm. Can I try it? If you want to. Grasping Hand? I guess. This is supposed to be against a creature, not against an item. Right, I'm letting you do this, though. It's fine. It makes sense. It's big enough. Make an","athletics check, using the strength of Bigby's"
Perception,"Yeah, please, shoot me in the neck. I thought you said, ""can I shoot at his genitals?"" Is Grog close enough for flanking for her? 21 won't hit him, right? Okay, so I'm going to try it again. Goddamn it. No, it's at disadvantage. Neither of them hit. Both arrows go wide, disappearing into the smoke of the room. You still hear the machine, (booming), behind you. Okay. Let's see if this is-- nope, it's an action because I'm a genius. I'm going to back up. I don't know if that'll do anything. I'm going to disengage and I'm going to back up on my broom.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check with"
Perception,"long javelin-like rod. Then you have to use the vise, after heating the metal, to twist the trammels. The actual design has them twisted because it helps conduct the divine energy to the point. And then using the chiseling tools, you have to work in the runes that match and channel the incantation that Scanlan's book has. It's a multi-process step that's going to require both of you to work together on this, since some elements of it are blacksmithing elements, some of it are tinkering. So we have to get into the other room first before we do any of that. Can I fly over and see if I can find any kind of apparatus that would--",MATT: Make a perception check.
Persuasion,"other one. Yeah. So planetar form. Go ahead and make a strength check, please. I am looking right now. My strength is 24, so plus seven. (scoffs) Again. Why again with the threes? Put that one away. Ten. Oh, I rolled a 13. You two tug on those chains, and they are not moving. Can the guardian do it? Hey, you that was attacking us. Can you get those chains?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"What do you-- Well, let's see. What do I have to do? The only hammer here is that maul, but all the chiseling and tinkering work takes a much smaller, more delicate hammer. I do have the Dwarven Thrower. It's going to have to be a smaller edge than that. Like what? Whisper? Edge? Yeah? It has to be a hammer. Like a rock hammer. Can we look around for a little teeny hammer?",MATT: Make an investigation check.

I know we bamfed out here, but do we have any idea how much time we have? How far away from Vasselheim we are? How far have we gone? Fom what you can tell, make a-- Don't make me make it. No, I'm ready. Let's go! I'm going to guess, too, because he's asking out loud. It's a good question.",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"As you go into this dive, you can hear the clashing of wyvern against gloomstalker. You hear the yelps and the shrieks of two different bestial cries. You hear shouts of humanoid and elven voices shouting as spears are tossed, arrows are let loose, and this aerial fray begins. With that, you glance forward as the dragon comes out of a dive, J'mon leading you towards this gargantuan entity. You can hear the further volume, the (massive footsteps). Even slower than that, probably, based on the gait it has to walk and the speed it's going. It is like watching a mountain with legs move. As you approach, what do you do? Do we see a clearing? A landing spot?","MATT: You can make a perception check, guys. All"
Perception,"87 points of bludgeoning damage, yes. Okay. I immediately drop form and start falling. Okay, any carryover damage, make sure to mark that. Does Uncanny Dodge affect this at all? Unfortunately, because you were relying on her eagle maneuverability, no. Okay. Well then, I shoot the wings out immediately. Okay. The wings emerge as both of you begin to plummet at this point. I'm okay. Keyleth? As you're plummeting, Vax, I need",you to roll a perception check.

As you're plummeting, Vax, I need you to roll a perception check. J'mon, they're fine. They told us they're fine! They'll be here any second! Don't worry. We did see this happen, right? You guys are right now hovering by this and looking back. You watch this occur. You see Vax get smacked, fall, and then his wings shoot out.","Vax, roll a perception check. With disadvantage."
Perception,"Yeah. Nearby. Is it always this cold? Well, not in here. But outside? Yeah, it's pretty cold. I'm sorry, what was your name? Kingston LaForge. Strong name. Thank you. I come from a long line of LaForges. Tell me about yourself. And as he goes, she starts inspecting the room, kind of listening. All right, you see a bunch of rowdy people all about you. No one out of the ordinary that you can see so far. Let's see here, what interesting",things? You know what? Make a perception check.
Perception,"You are grappled by the Mutton Man. He grabs you and says, ""Not so fast, dear, we're going to have ""some fun tonight."" You are restrained for right now. You cannot move. Do you know that Muffin Man? (singing) Do you know the muffin man? So you are grappled. Ooh! I have a thing! You are grappled! (cheering) It matches my albino, even! That's the Mutton Man. Now we go to Kingston. Kingston, before your roll, you have dropped to your knees. You are feeling like shit. You open",your eyes; roll a perception check.
Perception,"the used bottles and put them sort of behind the bar. Great. I start filling bottles with Greep. Bottles with Greep? You're going to use your action to do this? All right. So Valerie, who still doesn't really love you behind the bar is watching you fill up bottles, but she's okay because she got a bunch of gold out of it. So she's allowing it with a sneer. The man right behind you, Xavier, really doesn't like this, but he is a ninny, so he's just like (grumbling). For my bonus action, I toss him ten gold, as well. Oh, wow! Bonus action gold toss. That's nice. While you're down there getting these bottles, why",don't you roll a perception check? (whispering) I
Perception,"Oh, wait, no. It says here that it's a d6. Yeah, cast this on another creature. That player can add 1d6 to an attack, save, or skill check. Players are in charge of knowing their shit, except for Eric. Okay! Suddenly, without warning, without making a sound, a new mysterious figure emerges from the back room. Pushing Xavier away, he moves quickly and silently across the Ass Sailor with a speed none of you have ever witnessed. It's like the figure runs without moving his body. He floats in a beautiful sprint. As he passes by you, Gryffin, you suddenly feel even hotter than before. For an instant, he strikes fear into your",heart. Roll a perception check.
Athletics,"Free and clear in the wind. So who's going first? Who's going second? Are you going to talk to each other at all? You're just going to go? Are you going to hit each other? What's happening? Anyone want to go in first? I'm going to kick the bard in the ass, and when I kick him in the ass, I'm going to cast Light on his ass as he falls down into the hole. You can cast Light on an ass? It's anything I touch, and it's a cantrip, so his ass lights up as he falls down the hole. All right, so yes. Kingston, you fall in first. Am I like propeller guy in Titanic?","SAM: Sure. Yep. In fact, roll an athletics check."
Investigation,"knob. Are you still in the same marching order? Kingston first or Kingston second? I call down over my shoulder and say: hey, ass kicker! That's you. No, it's not. Clothesline, get up here. I'm ass flicker. Fuck you! I don't follow your orders. You tried to kill me! I want to investigate what's under the stairs. I don't even know why I'm still here! So nobody is going with you right now, Jayne. You're in front of a door. Gryffin, can you roll",an investigation check?
Perception,"So nobody is going with you right now, Jayne. You're in front of a door. Gryffin, can you roll an investigation check? And I'm going to do my best to see if there's any kind of trap on the door I'm looking at. 18. 18. Yes. All right. There is a false wall here that opens up into another corridor that leads this way. Let me see how I described it. Yes. Okay. It empties out into a wider room, and I'm going to do this. All right, so what would you like to do? Can I check to see if there's any trace of footprints or anything?","SAM: Sure, roll a perception check."
Investigation,"right? Yes. Another fucking snake. Whoa! I will take that. Okay. Do you proceed into this room or do you hang out? I turn around and I say: kitty-kitty, there seems to be another room down here and it seems to me that the frost is dissipating a bit on the floor. What do you think we should do? There's no sign of footprints, but I don't know that there were footprints on the other way. Jayne, do you see footprints? Besides your own, of course. I'm looking at the door in front of me and seeing if I can see anything hinky with it.",SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"That's so cool. So you've got a white whip that's lit up. So it's finally useful, is it? You're not there. That was Zahra showing up for a moment. You said there were potions on the table that I see now. You can investigate that, yeah. Is it possible for me at some point to try to grapple her? To grapple Jayne? If you want to walk down the hall, you can try. I've entered the room and I want to inspect the potions you said there were on the table?","SAM: Okay, roll an investigation check."
Investigation,"is-- I'll tell you. That is eight hit points back for you. Hooray, eight, hey! Hey, ugh. (coughs) I would say thanks, but I'm not going to argue. What do you need? You can try to kill me later. I want the little red-haired girl, you understand? Yeah. Red-haired girl. Got it. Got it, boss. Come on. So you join the others? I'll follow her. All right. So who is looking around the room, doing something? Can we check for traps?",SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check. What are
Investigation,"Can we check for traps? Sure. Make an investigation check. What are you checking for traps? The floor. You said there was shit written on the pillar? Can I see if I recognize any of the symbols on the pillar? Sure. What languages do you speak? I speak Common, Elven, Halfling, Valley Girl. What was your check, Mary? 18. And I speak Elvish, Abysmal and Common. Abyssal. You're looking at the floor specifically? Okay. Brian, can you roll an","investigation check? Okay, so Mary, looking on the"
Perception,"Maybe you're immune now that it bit you and you could just go touch it and press one of the eyes and maybe it won't do anything to you. I recommend trying all the eyes. It would make such a good story, though, in your book if you did it, Kingston. Oh, I know, but if it goes bad, who will be around to write the book? Surely a fan such as yourself would be dedicated enough to-- Did you always write your books or did you have a ghostwriter? Oh, I didn't have a ghostwriter. Are you kidding me? The pain that I went through. I was able to pull from so many different places.",ASHLY: Could I also do a perception check? Do I
Perception,"Not until after this spell is done. 13! Aw, 13? Plus three is 16. He beat it! Damn! He beat it! Spell burned! Now you know how I felt all night, Liam Oberon. You know, Jayne, I couldn't help but overhear. You were talking down the hall, and these caverns echo. Did I not hear you say that you may or may not be associated with the Chained Oblivion? Was he anywhere near me when I had that private conversation? The caverns do carry audio. Why don't you",roll a perception check? A retroactive perception
Investigation,"No, I'm at that tunnel entrance. I never entered. Okay, got it. So you're calling her back? Great. And Frankie? I'm going to stay right there. Great. So you take four points of poison damage as this pillar shoots out a bit of poison. You're standing near it, unfortunately. Look, I just want to be close to the action. Cool. You guys kind of get the sense that the longer you stay in here the more shit's going to start happening. Anyone want to look at the door? I would like to look at the door.","SAM: Okay, make an investigation check."
Perception,"Can you see if there are numbers, like four numbers on the ceiling that are the same color? What color is the lock? The lock is a basic gray. However, the slot where you line up the correct numbers has a faint color on it. The first two are orange. The second two are green. Okay, so I'm looking at the padlock. Because you're up at the ceiling and I'm at the door, right? Two orange, two green. What do you see up top? An Irish flag. All right. Which numbers are orange, which numbers are green up on the ceiling?",SAM: Can you make a perception check? It's really
Perception,"numbers. Grab your pencil. There's many orange numbers. They're all across the top of the ceiling. They are six, one, eight, seven, two, one, eight, two, four, nine, two, seven, one, zero. You're a terrible person. Can I use this item about this? What is this item? Is it the earring? It can tell you something about a person or a creature, but not about a room. Okay. Were those the orange numbers? Those were the orange numbers. What are the green numbers?",SAM: Make another perception check.
Investigation,"still standing, or did it explode after hitting us? There's four pillars. One of them poofed out poison. It was rough. Sorry, guys. On the other side of the door, you hear a low (snarling). Oh, fuck. All right. Did that sound like a cat to anyone else? No, that sounded like a lizard or something. And the lock looks like what over there? It's like a big padlock. Is there anything I can see on the lock? Tell me about the lock.",SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"fact about you, and she's chosen to know your weaknesses. My weaknesses? I don't know what those are. I could tell her many things. Well, how about your-- let's see here. I will tell you lots of things in the interest of not slowing down this episode. You learn that I'm very weak and easily hit. You learn that I am almost out of spells. And you have learned that I am part of four generations of women that have served the Chained Oblivion, which is a god that everyone has heard of. And the Chained Oblivion wants to destroy everything and I am fucking crazy, just like my mother.",SAM: Make a perception check. Or investigation
Perception,"Say that all again, Liam? Six is one-third of 18. Seven is one-third of 21. Eight is one-third of 24. Nine is one-third of 27. Ten is one-third of-- there's nothing there. What is ten one-third of? 30. So try-- well, there's four numbers, though. Those numbers that you're looking at are orange. The first two slots on the lock are orange. So we need to find the two numbers that are green now.",SAM: Make a perception check.

I'm thinking maybe this might be where the Knuckles are from. Can I touch it and see if the oven mitts do anything? Their general, faint vibration never stops. There's a perpetual, very minute hum to them. Touching it doesn't seem to have any effect or change. The proximity seems to be triggering some sort of harmonization.

About 40 feet in diameter, about 50 feet tall at its apex, and in the center of it, you see a partially collapsed dark stone pavilion or small temple. At the bottom in the middle? Well, you guys turn and it's in the center of this chamber that rises up before you in the center of this small, egg-shaped opening, the space. And you see this made of a deep, dark, grayish, almost black stone structure that looks beautifully made. The craftwork is distinctly dwarven. Is it old?",MATT: You can go make an investigation check on it
Religion,"jammed into the side of the structure. And looking past the craggy piles of loose rock, you can see shattered glass across the ground, and part of the rock as the rockslide has pushed into one of these glass panels that marks the exterior of the small, gazebo-like temple structure. It seems to have filled, from what you can see at least at this distance, a portion of the interior as well. There is a double door in the front that is currently closed and the right side of the door is buried partially by the remainder of this rockslide that has come to a halt at the base of the structure.

I bet it's a crypt, which means that it's trapped, and I bet that means there's something expensive and interesting inside. DM, question. Yes. Because I can't remember for sure, didn't, in our story somewhere, we come up with a solution for Pike's noisiness? Something that quieted her down? She had stealth boots.

Investigation,"Yeah! We're all going to get out of the chamber. Okay, so you all clear out of the chamber. 30. 30, okay. You find there's actually a pressure cartridge at the very top of the box, so you slip your dagger in, so it remains depressed. As you lift the lid, you put your thumb over it and hold it, trap never triggers. Looking inside, it's empty. (shutting noise) (shutting noise) No problem. Just go down the line.",MATT: All right.

Investigation,"So, as you go and take a moment and check the door, there is a bronze image faintly carved into it of a stocky dwarven man with a thick beard that touches his toes. It completely covers the front of his body. He wears plated armor that comes to dangerous, jagged, curved-up points. As far as dwarves go, this one looks about as unhappy and unapproachable as any dwarf, and you've encountered some pretty gnarly dwarves in your time. As you glance down, there does appear to be an opening for a key and there is an oval turning mechanism, like a vault door, like a smaller vault.

Arcana,"I'm just saying. What's your hammer like? My Dwarven Thrower? It can be single or double-handed. It's not a warhammer. It flies back to my hand, though. Oh, that's pretty cool. It is. But you can never have enough hammers. Do you mind if I--? No, but I mean, how are you going to wield this? You have two other weapons, don't you? Are you kidding me?

Perception,"be falling away to some semblance of actual holding architecture. And eventually it reveals a much larger hall of very apparent dwarven architecture. The ceiling now pulls up to about 60 feet above you, stalagmites dripping condensation from the shadow above, you can hear the distant drops in the distance of the cavern before you. You can make out broken ruins built into the walls of each side. Ancient stone homes and structures that now crack and crumble with each footfall of the titan. As you hear the (impact) of the next heavy footfall, you see as a couple of stones tumble from some of these structures, clattering across the cavern floor.",LIAM and MATT: Perception check.
Stealth,"Further than your visual range. Further than my visual range. Okay, we've got company up ahead. So, yeah. What kind of an alien language? Any that we recognize? You hear this faint-- sounds like a voice, droning, slightly changing pitch, but it's so disparate and so distant that you can't make up anything other than noticing that it exists amongst the steady, low, rhythmic rumbles of each separate footfall of the beast you now currently are within.

And hits the water and now floats up, unmoving in the pond there. You can see the liquid around it darkening. You just killed an NPC! We're not in Emon in the market square! No one knows about this. The sheer force of the first dagger sends it off the broken statue and it falls into the water and it is now unmoving.",LIAM: We are in hell. Perception check.
Investigation,"It was holding a baby. Flame Tongue is out, what am I looking at? Do you want to look at its face? Yeah. Okay, as you pull one of the spines and pull it back, you can see toothy jaws, humanoid-like, but grey and coming to a point where you can see jagged teeth in the top and bottom row, and one singular large yellowish eye in the center of its face, no nose, and the eye is slightly rolled back. Liam knows what this thing is, but Vax does not. Fuck this thing! I'm going to start looking-- what are the trinkets on it?",MATT: Make an investigation check.

About 40 feet past that, the tunnel ends at a set of heavy stone eight-foot doors. The surrounding cavern has slid in places, but it doesn't appear to be burying the door, to a certain extent. They're just closed. You don't see any handles  you don't see any keyhole entry point. They're just two stone slabs. They're simple. They're smooth. There's no intricate scrolling. There's no Dwarven text. They're just impeding your progress. Let's have a look. Yeah, I'll look around.",MATT: Investigation check.

You watch as where it meets the stone, cracks begin to form at the edge and with one shift (shifting), it seems to push forward and (falling and impacting). You actually broke whatever mechanism was holding it in place and caused that side of the door to fall inward (booming). As it hits the ground, you hear the echo (echoing boom).

Perception,"with small entryways that lead to each. The floor is covered in flaked shale, dirt, the occasional glitter of some sort of errant coin or gold piece or copper piece. At this point, again you hear the distant (booming) of a titan footfall. The chamber shakes, and a fresh layer of dust falls, clouds a bit, before resting to the floor. That's the most you can make out at first glance inside this chamber. There's more tunnels. Looking for traps, dead guys, from the door. Can I do a peek and check to see if there's signs of any cave-in potentials? Potential cave-ins?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"somewhere that leads out? With your face? Yeah, I want to feel the wind on my face. Thanks. 28. Glancing about this chamber, it's very well made. In fact, based on the smatterings of gold on the ground and glancing about the way it's built, this looks to be specifically a vault. This once contained probably a portion of the wealth of the people of this town. Oh, somebody rolled this place. We don't hear anybody or anything? Not at the moment, no.",LIAM: 18 investigation check for traps and dead
Perception,"17 damage? All righty. So a second hit slams, and you could see the first one where it burst out, burned and singed the necrotic flash. The second one hits, not as impactful but still, it looks relatively hurt. That ends Pike's go. Can't she move away from him? Oh, no, because he will get an attack. She could move back five, but it will get an attack of opportunity if she does that. No, she's going to face him down. Okay. Grog, you're up. I would like to rage and run up and to this doorway. Five, 10, 15, 20. Can I see anything in this room?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Nature,"your arms, to your hand. With that, your fingers widen and the hammer falls to the ground, there. That hold that it had on you is lifted. I think I'm going to leave this here, if that's cool with you guys. She gives you the mom look and says, ""Don't touch it, okay?"" Do you have time to attune to your other thing? Yeah, I'll pick up the Bloodaxe out of the Bag of Holding and start attuning to that again. Old trusty Bloodaxe. So you guys are taking a short rest to attune? In caves and other natural underground",settings. Make a nature check. The radius is only
Insight,"And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet. How do you play Dungeons and Dragons? Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you? I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed",to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Perception,"incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing. Brother. Yeah? Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me. I turn around and look at her and go: all right. You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you. You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear. Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?",LIAM: I love you. Perception check. Investigation
Stealth,"it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them. Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see. And then come back down. Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet-- All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring. That's right. I forgot about the ring. All right. Let's do that. So as you guys glide up on the broom,","stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth"
Athletics,"this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage. What do you see? It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through. Well, get a fucking closer look. If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down. Yes, but quiet is the key word. Is it?

Perception,"Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock. Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can. Do we see any other openings?",MATT: This would be a perception check.

And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this-- In tempo. This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it. I'm going to do the one-inch punch.","MATT: Make an athletics check. With advantage,"
Nature,"can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven. Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere. A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark. People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done. Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?",MATT: You can make a nature check.
Nature,"What do I do? Go see if you can walk through the mirror. Tap the mirror. Light the brazier! We've done that before and we all exploded. Yeah, but it's Vax. Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff? If you enter the chamber to, yeah. Hand me some ash. I'll test it. I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.",MARISHA: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this
Investigation,"Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans) Wow. No. What is it? (groans) Is it for real? You are lying! Look at that face! You are not lying! Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe. It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is. Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"That's true. That could be. Simon (slithering) moves over. I lean over to Percy, I say: science! Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway. I'm going to touch the door. And say goodbye. Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm? It is beginning to get warm. It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance. No problem. I'll get it down. No! Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes? And maybe it'll open again. Yeah. Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are? Coming up from behind us?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in? Can't you call to him? Simon? Come here, buddy. There's no response. (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt. What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something? He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers",creepers! Perception check? 29!
Investigation,"It's cooled off enough, right? Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to. Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once? Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling. Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable. I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"now gone. But they're revealed by heat. Where were they? They were upper and lower corner, yeah. I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands. Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again. What is the symbol of? It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it? It looks to be a simple triangular symbol,",marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Investigation,"But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols? Let's try pushing all four buttons. The regular buttons or the magic ones? Please stand by. I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button. Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right? Was there anything there? You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move. It's just a wall. No depression, no toggle?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"symbols in the frame? As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols. What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons? Except we have two twos, and no three? I know. One, two, four! No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together-- And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more? Can I clear off the door area that we walked through? So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing).",Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers! Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons. Yes, so now we've just got to do it. Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame? I gave it a little bit of a rub. I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror. Okay. It taps. Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward. Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it. So it's a big 180, going right up? Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around. Do we hear anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me. Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do? Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"to do? Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from? Make an investigation check. Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole? Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals. 23. Not in a long time. Is there shattered remnants of the door?

Are they appearing buzzing more?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance. So should we fly up to that window? I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us. Let's do it. And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go. Yes, we do. She cast it. All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your",stealth checks.
Perception,"you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple. Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window. Is there a story? It looks to be coming from the base. From down below. Can we see in one of the windows?",MATT: You can look inside. Make a perception check.

Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made? If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved. Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around? If you want to. Grog has it. Do you want me to pull it out?",LAURA: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?

Not at the moment, no. I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18",arcana check.
Investigation,"our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself. Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy. It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose. All right, focus! Let's get out of this dome. Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered? On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind. Are there exits?",MATT: Make an investigation check. You don't see

Arcana,"I think I can take this thing. ""So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"" You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere. I just need to try again harder. Wait! You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration? This is an ability check, right? This is an ability check, yes. Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?",MATT: No. It was an arcana check.
Perception,"on a robe. Yeah. All right. They know that the orb was with two of the others, so as long as we keep the distance, everything should be fine. Oh, so now we're legit. Yeah, we look like we're with them. Hey, twins? How do our flanks look if we move forward? Is it just trees? Is it buildings? I was about to ask. We see flickering light far away, but I don't trust anything. I want to specifically see if anything besides twitching fingers and toes are hiding closer to us.",MATT: Make a perception check.

Perception,"in that direction, at an upward angle. You get the sense that this is near the edge of the city. Can we see any light from above us? Other than the very faint bio-luminescence left by the little patches of dull orange here and there that give you a sense of the overall scope and enclosure of the chamber, no other light source. There's no opening. So the option is really to keep moving forward and find our way out. Same option as ten minutes ago. The figures in the distance. Can we tell by scale how big they are? Do they look humanoid or bigger?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"seeing each other. The middle one has a view of each. Occasionally, they'll interface  they converse a bit between the two of them. But for the most part they're definitely keeping a look out. They're very vigilant and looking out into the empty space before them. Seeing which way Keyleth is looking, Vax stands a bit on tiptoe and puts his chin on her shoulder and looks in the distance, and sees the armored figure. Are we close enough to tell if that armored figure has a sword? I can lend the scope of my gun, if that helps. Okay, that would probably help. Make a",perception check.
Perception,"something is scrying on the space. As soon as you kick back you're like, ""Shit. That's probably what it was."" Shit, that's probably what it was. He knows we're coming. There was that moment when you two were falling to your deaths before we entered the titan. You were away from me, so it's possible that he knows. I'm sure he knows we're around. Do we want to deal with these people or get around them? Do we see any other tunnels that aren't guarded?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"was like, ""Odell, go tell Viscon."" Yeah, but he was running away. He wasn't the one holding the sphere. Odell wasn't holding the sphere. It was the green robe guy. Who's the green robe guy, then? Gray. Yeah, it was gray. Hold on, I pull it out and look at it. Yeah, it was gray. Wait, we have the actual robe? Just give me that. Are they written on the tags like a school play? Yeah, does it have his name written in it anywhere so he keeps track of it?",MATT: Roll an investigation check.
Stealth,"this for other folks. We're keeping within Pass Without a Trace. I'll say make a wisdom check. To see if I can actually do it? To see how well you manage to mask the terrain nearby. I stand ten feet away from her and give her a plus two. Oh, that's so low. I know. Eight. Plus two! Oh, a wisdom saving throw or a check? A check.

You have three archways. I go to the one that had that knight near it, right? That's the middle one. I'll go to the middle one. I'm going to keep the ball in front of me to obscure me a little bit.

As you're shouting this to skeletons, you glance off over the back of your shoulder and you see a bit of torchlight emerge as a black orb burns through a stone wall. Let's go! I wait until everybody's through, and do I see a crack or nice weakened part in the archway that I can smack?",MATT: Make an investigation check. You put your

Yeah, the rocks begin to collapse around you and they begin to pin your body, but the physical strength you have manages to break through and you are not held in the collapsing tunnel beginning to push forward. You all begin to rush. Slowly the sound of the collapsing tunnel subsides as you begin to glance upward and see the color of green-blue light approaching. Approaching us? Or we're approaching it? We can see the sky and we're causing the collapse behind us? We're up at Thar Amphala? Can we slow down at all, or do we have to keep booking it to avoid the cave-in?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"So we can slow down. You guys can slow down. You're about 15 feet from the surface at this point. Very carefully see what's up there and find some cover. I still got Pass Without a Trace because I didn't cast Hunter's Mark. Who are you people? What do you want with me? I reach over to Scanlan, and I rip his hair off. You reach out, and your hand passes through nothing. That is a great hat.","LIAM: I got a new 45 stealth check, so I'm going"
Perception,"gloomstalkers flying around? At this point, looking up, you see about three or four that are maybe 70 or 80 feet above you. But they're doing passes. They're not being stationary and they're constantly circling through. As you glance up and look and nudge away, you can see their yellow eyes piercing from their black, lightless form. Their wings, as they expand and shift, you can see that faint glance, the beams of their vision, scanning across the rooftops. They're all very intent on seeing what's going through the city. And do I see any motherfuckers on the streets?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"That's assuming we hit no pockets. 240 feet. That gets us 480 total feet possible in two hours. Halfway. It's more likely that this thing is sitting in a pool of stilted water. It's probably not encased in a passageway of stone, because how did it get there? If that's the case, we have to move on foot above ground quickly and get close, and then I can tunnel us down. I think that's the only way. Other than that, we're taking several hours to get there at a very slow pace. And we might not get there. Two dozen plus things flying around.

Unless we all want to decide, right here and right now, to try and get closer to the sword than the thousand feet we are potentially away from it right now, together as a team, and then cast the mansion.

Stealth,"They're all keeping a net of movement around. I'm going to walk up to Grog and Pike. You hear rocks beginning to emerge-- I grab Grog and Pike. We're going to run together. I activate my Silence spell. You two are in my Silence spell. I've got Pike in my hand. And you still have Pass Without a Trace. Still Pass Without a Trace. No, because when you cast Locate Object, that stopped. I recast it! It's okay. I recast it. Okay, mark that off. So as you guys all emerge topside, rushing this 20 feet distance, I","need you all to make stealth checks. Grog, you"
Investigation,"They can't hear you. It is visible, so is there a closet in here or some sort of alcove? If I recall correctly, the entrance is only visible to people that you signify. People who see invisible things can see it. The entrance shimmers faintly and is five feet wide and ten feet tall. You and any creature you designate can enter. Okay, it is visible, but only creatures you designate can enter. That's the difference. So it is a faint shimmer. We have to hide it, yeah.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"right? I sense the twins. I'm going to cast Locate Object one more time. Oh, that that takes me out of stealth, doesn't it? No. Oh. But I have Pass Without a Trace, which is still going. Do you vaguely remember the direction it was in? So maybe we go vague for a minute? So I pop my head out, Jaws-ing. And I point in the direction and have her keep following it. And I'm going to be like-- I'm going to follow their footsteps with my tremorsense. And as such, you don't have to make a","stealth check. You're down below, and you follow"
Stealth,"re-stealth before I come back out so I don't bamf in the middle. Right. Okay, so you duck into a small alleyway. You guys are keeping out of view and waiting for the swarms of undead in the street, and as you come around the corner you immediately see about 12 or 13 zombies clattering past. As you're waiting for them to pass by, eventually they get quieter and quieter. You take a minute and you cast the spell Locate Object, and it's a much steeper angle now. You're getting much closer to it. So do you want to keep going? Yes. I want to re-stealth and move until I'm directly over it.","MATT: Roll another stealth check. Both of you,"
Investigation,"No, she just breathed. She stress exhaled. My hand, and it made a farting noise, sorry. You're fine. You get about another 85, 100 or so feet, and it's nearly directly below you. You're about halfway between the edge of the wall and where Entropis, the tower, is. Okay. I'm going to tap my foot on the ground and point directly down to you, Keyleth. Directly down. Doing this as I go. Okay. So you swim down. Yeah, swimming down. Okay, and you're feeling through earth. Make",an investigation check.
Investigation,"leave at a moment's notice. Or we should maybe leave right now. No, we wait a little bit. I think that they can get back. And then what? Then we all have to leave. I go deeper. Okay. So you dive into the liquid? Not into the liquid! Just through the stone, going deeper. Okay. You coast along the outside and you can sense that you're traveling on the outskirts of this descending tunnel where the acidic liquid is encased, and eventually it rounds out. I do another sword check.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"the somewhat wet, grassy ground of the swamp where you-- You said the pools where you first emerged last time? Yeah, where the water elemental is. Yeah. Where the nymph was. You guys all land in these pools. Looking around, you can see the darkened wood over you. The sound of crickets and nearby insects fill the air, and for the first time in a long time, though your blood pumping would not tell you, a stillness and a peace in the vicinity around you.

Perception,"the three large towers that sits in the courtyard of this fortress. The tower of Warchief Barfta is currently in flames, his chamber being burned as the thatch and mud that comprises its exterior are beginning to burn. You can see now everyone's mobilizing around you, grabbing weapons as a series of arrows come arcing in from over one of the walls. Three or four nearby uruk go (dying sounds) and fall to the ground, dead immediately. I take a helmet off one and put it in my bag. All right, what are you guys doing? I take out a crossbow, do I see any intruders?","MATT: Perception check, please."
Perception,"this tower. You see numerous ruined bodies of uruk, like the one that you saw guarding the stairway on the way up, are now littering the floor, near that opening in the window. And there in the center you see Warchief Barfta, muscles swollen in rage. He kneels amidst these bodies, repeatedly slamming his fist into the face of a still-living would-be assassin, who's now on the ground just being clutched by the throat (roars). He's just like gone feral in his face at this point. Does he look like he's in trouble? Does he look hurt? Injured? On fire?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"look hurt? Injured? On fire? Make a perception check. I'm very perceptive. 15. Glancing in, you can see he looks wounded on one arm, one arm looks like it has a few gashes, but for the most part seems to be not too worse for wear. As soon as the door bashes in, he's like growling at this one uruk on the ground who's partially broken with one eye swollen shut. Glances over, looks in your direction, ""What're you doing? Get in and help!"" Okay, I try to break through the rest of the door.","MATT: Okay, so make an athletics check. Since"
Persuasion,"up at you, eyes wide from the pressure. (coughing) Can you answer some questions for us, please? Why are you being so polite? Oh, no. I scream in his face. Somebody ask him questions. I'll walk over, I'll get real close to him. Hello friend, my name is Mozuu the Chosen. I've heard the voice of Sauron. He told me the strong take what they want. You see all this around here? That could be part of yours if you're strong enough. You tell us why, why you'd do this, and riches await you.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"Captains! ""Now hurry! Before the tracks go cold! Go!"" Again, you asked me to count blades, and yet now-- ""Count them quickly! I don't care!"" It's a figure of speech, Mozuu. I'll say there's more than a hundred. We're going. We will bring you glory and we will bring you his head. ""Good. Hundred swords. Heh."" Can I run across the room to the hole that was blown in the other side of the room, check for clues or how they did it, or if there's any trace of who came in?","MATT: Make an investigation check in the vicinity,"

Make an investigation check in the vicinity,",and then a perception check looking through the hole.
Perception,"Okay! Looking through the hole that is blasted into the side of this wall, there is a number of crumpled uruk, you see there are two assassins on the ground, both with ruined forms, seemingly the explosion that they brought here also blew them apart. The style you can appreciate. But you do see they have-- somehow through this explosion, three small encased leather-bound orbs that survived the detonation. You take and sniff it, it's a very familiar smell of powder. Explodey powder? Can I pocket those three? You do indeed. Yeah. Oh, that's cool.",MATT: What was your perception check?
Perception,"Do you have like fancy pins or something we could wear? Or the Orc Four! The Orc Four! The Forcs! The Forcs! The Forcs! ""No. All right, Forcs it is!"" (cheering) ""You! Are the Barfta Forcs!"" Can we get little patches that say ""Get Forc-ed""? Oh, you should, you should just carve it in because you're a Scar-Artist! Yeah, hold on, just one minute! While you do that, I'm going to go count some blades from this window.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"I'm to interpret the eyes? Exactly. That what makes us a team! That's what makes us the Forcs, apparently. The Forcs! So I want you to make a dexterity check. (laughs) That was good. Oh, that's a million. 22. 22. You, of all the scars you've carved across the group, you saved the best for Mozuu. Even though it's a bumpy ride on the back of an olog, it's a beautiful display on this helmet. It's got mosaic work, filigree! It's really nice. You're really proud of it, and also roll a","perception check, because you're now the person"
Stealth,"them that are side by side that are emerging on the opposite side within range, so you could probably hit them both. So I need you to go ahead and roll-- actually, no, it's a dexterity saving throw on their point. Okay, so strangely enough, they both succeed. An 18 and a 20. You throw it, and they're so fast as they dart past. They're small and they're wiry and they're lively, and as soon as you throw and lob it, the both just separate and it splashes harmlessly on the ground below them. You see the acid burn up. No effect, unfortunately. Can I use my bonus action to nimble escape, and I want to jump off your shoulders and hide. Sure, yeah. So we'll say you dart off, and",go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Athletics,"While this is happening, Mozuu, it's your turn. There are two in the distance? There are two more. There's one that got up on the ground that's in front of Eden, there's one that's rushing in, and there's one that's on top of Eden's shoulders right now. I'll go for the one that's on top of Eden's shoulders. I want to pull him off and bite, and try and rip his throat out? Okay. Wow. Said so casually! ""I would like to bite and--"" As you rush up to the side to grab it, make",a grapple check. Roll an athletics check.

I thought I was supposed to run, but I can't run! Why? There's ghouls! Mozuu, you're up. It worked once. I'm going to grab him and try to rip his throat out. Okay. Now you have a taste of ghoul in your mouth. You rush over to Arburuk. Make a grapple check. Grapple is plus what?",MATT: It's an athletics check.
Stealth,"Fail. All of you take 2d8 thunder damage, and you're pushed ten feet away. Roll, Travis. Roll 2d8. 13. You asshole. I mean, you glob! Both of you guys take 13 points of thunder damage and are blown ten feet back as this small rolling ball explodes in a concussive blast. Both of the ghouls get scattered into nothing. The sound of the explosion echoes throughout the mountains, and both of you guys get pushed back ten feet, almost landing on the ground. Can I bonus action my nimble escape? To hide?",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"have. Fair enough. All right, so that brings us to Eden. I'm 80 feet away, and my darkvision can't see that far, so all I heard was an explosion in the As the only surviving member of the Forcs, I will say a word to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to carry on the mantle of this mission. And I will keep running as fast as I can away. Okay. You bolt away. This poor little ghoul has no sight of you. As that ends your turn, it is now the ghoul's turn. It's like, (panting). It's lost and doesn't see you. It's going to make a",perception check. Nope! It begins scrambling its

It does get an attack of opportunity on you as you emerge. That's going to hit. That's a 17 plus five. Uncanny dodge! Okay, so that's five points of slashing damage, which you take half of, so that's two. But you go running past? Double charge? Okay. As you guys are running, they're pretty quick, and they're keeping pace with you. They can't quite catch up to you, but they're following. As you're rushing, since you're the furthest behind, make a",perception check.

Acrobatics,"olog-hai physical self able to withstand such paltry blows. You're called Unstoppable for a reason. That's right. Unbreakable. That's me. All right, so. That ends the orc's turn there, the one you crushed there, the one that's sleeping. Yeah, they don't get a saving throw until they get hit or the spell ends. Fun. All right.

Stealth,"you, at the moment. Are there trees around us? No trees. You're in Mordor right now. Yep, just thought I'd ask. You know, some ashen trees? I mean, there are jagged rocks. Part of the terrain itself is a series of broken shale and large rock faces that jut out of the ground from seismic activity. Should we hide behind rocks? It's caragors. You hear caragors?

Okay. So you watch as Skak disappears behind a rock. What are you guys doing? I also try to duck behind a rock. Are we going to sit here? I'm going to duck behind a rock and wait for one to show its face around a rock, and then I'm going to hit it with my maul.","MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with"
Stealth,"I'm going to hit it with my maul. Okay, make a stealth check with disadvantage. Why don't we try to go past them?! Seven. Okay. You watch as Arby nods, follows suit, right behind where Skak is. The rock's almost the size of Arby, so you see this outline of Arby clutching this rock and trying to act quiet as the armor (clanking). Look and see if we can make it past them! You, stick your head out. All right, I will stealthily see if I can see any caragors. Move out, look around.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Athletics,"do? Thunderous Smite. All right, so you pull forth your war pick, and you're going to go ahead and strike which one? The one that was closest to Arby. Okay. Or I should go for the other one? It's a little high for you right now. Because of her size, she can barely reach it. You'd have to try and make your way up either Arby, or climb part of the cliff side. Up to you. Do you mind if I climb you? Not a bit. I'm going to climb.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Perception,"no longer moving. Oh, are you okay, Mozuu? Yes. Mozuu? I am a talking caragor! I walk over and try to push the caragor. Since you're not in immediate danger, it takes you a minute or so. You all manage to push this giant caragor corpse off of Mozuu's body. You're sore, you're crushed, you're sweaty and covered in blood, but you're now standing. See! That wasn't so bad! Is our prisoner still around, or did he run away?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"sprinting away. I could catch him! Can you? I can! Let's take off after him. I'm going to sprint after him using Step of the Wind. You're going to use another ki point. With your speed and double dash, as he's sprinting. (heavy panting) About a minute later or so, you catch up right behind him and he's within grasp of you. He hasn't noticed you, he's just eyes on the prize right towards the fortress. I grab the top of his skull.",MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple him.
Perception,"olog mitts. Can't run from the Forcs! ""I was running from the caragors! Self-preservation, mate!"" That makes sense. All right, we'll wait here for the others and then we follow this plan. ""Yes!"" You're on our side. ""Of course!"" I trust you implicitly. ""Don't worry!"" I don't worry about anything. Can we see if he's killing him or having a chat?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Intimidation,"""Just Borg."" Borg, I thought I had lost you. I don't know I'm sorry and it will never happen again. You guys approach as Eden is cradling this freshly bandaged goblin. Did we kill him? Oh, you fixed him up? Why did you do that?! He's our ticket in! Oh! I think you can still trust us, all right? ""Okay."" Or you can take that as a sign of things to come if you do it again!",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Perception,"I have a crowbar. You have a bagpipe? I like to play music sometimes, that's all. I think we're good, let's just get on with it. All right. So as you guys slowly begin to encroach upon the outer elements of this fortress, the points of torchlight burning in these braziers along the top side of it, you can see guards walking back and forth along the edges, shortbows at the side, nocked and ready in case any sign of danger happens. You can see a front-- actually, for you guys that are closest, go ahead and make a",perception check.
Stealth,"Yeah, it does. Shrak yeah! Okay, do we send him first? No, because if he gets in, he runs away. I'm just saying. Yeah, we'll go first. Right? Which one of us? Who's the most beaten up? Who's been through absolute hell? You. There's two things I know. I'm going first-- And that's it. I'm going first. Go through that shrak hole! All right. So I want you guys to all make",stealth checks to make your way around that hole
Stealth,"first-- And that's it. I'm going first. Go through that shrak hole! All right. So I want you guys to all make stealth checks to make your way around that hole without being seen. We're stealthing? Yes, and that's disadvantage for you, Arby, unfortunately. Because you have heavy armor on. (high-pitched) Oh man! But I rolled so well on that first one! (high-pitched) Well, roll a second time! So the roll plus dexterity?","MATT: No, it's a stealth check."
Deception,"Bonk! Say something! You look up and there's three archers that all have their bows notched on you, going, ""What ""the hell are you--"" Brick, say something! ""Oh. We're gathering for the alchemist. Getting some more prime shrak for his boomy balls! ""Yeah!"" He's going to attempt to make a deception-- oh, not bad, actually. Let's see if they-- rolling against myself here. ""All right. Who are them?"" We're the Forcs! ""What's the Forcs?"" It's what you eat with! We work for Ur-Gram!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Investigation,"doubles my jump distance. Distance, does that mean height? Well, yeah. But horizontal distance-- we'll say height for this. What's your strength modifier? Four-- one. My strength modifier is one. Right. It doubles it, so you get (grunts). I'll say you barely-- because of your height. Because you are an olog, you barely get your fingers up on the top. Go ahead and make a strength saving throw to try and pull yourself up. Okay. (scoffs) Nine. You drop back down. It's just too high. Are there any rocks around?",MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to.
Investigation,"around and try to fire back at you. The other one that's running past is going to go ahead and pull out a torch and try to light it. All right, so that ends your turn. They're going to go. One is going to take another shot at you. There we go! That is a 24 to hit. Do we all get-- I did not make an action. Oh shit! That's right, you didn't. So you go. Shrak hole. Shrak hole. You go in? Yes, I'm going in. Okay. So you go ahead and make a-- as you","dive into it, make an investigation check to try"
Acrobatics,"Are we going into the shrak hole? I'm going into the shrak hole! How big is the shrak hole? Can all of us fit in there? Well, as you dive in, it pushes you out the other side. You get shoved out, plopped out, covered in shrak. And you look around, immediately you can see, as you wipe your eyes off the shrak, everybody is now starting to look around at the signal and begin to grab their weapons and start preparing for an incursion. You dive into it. You get halfway in-- this is a very small space underneath and you're a very large olog. I'm going to need you to make either an athletics",check or an acrobatics check to try and push
Deception,"there but they're all keeping at bay. You watch as a hand comes up behind the crowd and goes, ""Hold!"" Everyone was like-- they are ready to tear at you but they begin to part at the center and you watch with heavy steps as an olog-hai approaches with a giant, mutated underbite with tusks that reach up past the nostril. The eyes peek through from heavily scarred muscle tissue where a face once existed, but has since been torn and not healed very well over.

It's still bound by the rope. But you get up onto it now. You watch as this massive dragonborn gets up onto the gloomstalker, which is now currently on the ground, trying to right itself now, still wrapped in the rope. You can release the rope now.

And I watched that Death Knight burn the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. And he cut the still-beating heart out of our goliath. And then these buzzards came to pick my bones, thinking I was dead. But I wouldn't die. The queen had another plan for me. The queen? What kind of queen? I hold up my shield.","MATT: Make a religion check, Scanlan."

And the stealth check you're going to be rolling is going to be to see whether or not anything notices you on the back of a gloomstalker. The gloomstalker is not going to register on the radar of any of the current watching creatures, because it's part of its posse for the moment. So is this with disadvantage for plate armor, or not? I would say no, because it isn't a",movement-based stealth check; you're just trying

To maintain hold on it, because its physical form-- and it's interesting, now that you've been this close to it, and you've been wrestling it, you feel it's partially corporeal. There's something about its physicality that is almost gelatinous. Like it's made up of a combination of shadow and physical will. And as you clutch into it, your fingers dig and begin to seep into it, almost like a cluster of tar. But it holds you fast, and you're there","underneath. Make a stealth check, without"

Are you just as charismatic as Scanlan One? I've got all the words to make the girls like me. Okay, I don't care. Okay, Keyleth is going to try to do a one-two punch here.

Entangle is an action? Yes, and then I'm running and jumping and grabbing for the rest of my movement. Do we need some more tape? Actually, I can finally use the layer over here. Do you want me to get the tape? All right, you leap over. That's the rest of your turn. After entangling her, you run, leap, and as the wind from the mantle picks up, you watch this",gust of wind lift her. Make an athletics check.

Sleight of Hand,"Goddamn it. He's probably looking at you, Scanlan. You have the book! We can't lose you! For real! Gulp. He's glaring at you. And with that, ""Come for a ride with me,"" (whooshing) and begins to rise up even higher into the air. Can I hold onto Bigby? I wish to let him leave while I hold onto Bigby. Okay. And get my attack of opportunity. (laughter) War Caster. Come on. Go for it. Come on.","LIAM: Bigby, make a sleight of hand check."
Athletics,"Okay. Still in our synchronised swimming stance, I fly up and-- So you fly up from this point. Got to pull you up a bit. I'm going to drop Grog onto Vecna and then do my own thing. Okay. So you fly up. Grog, what are you doing at this point? I'm going to use that held action to attack twice. Okay. You'll be falling if she drops you. No. My first attack is going to be a grapple and with the second attack, I'm going to shank him.",MATT: Roll an athletics check.
Perception,"now. He does take 4d6. Thank you. 13 points of radiant damage. And I'm going to try to hit him again with sharpshooter. 28. I moved that. I'm going to roll it again, because I didn't see what it was. 29 minus five is 24 to hit? Okay. That's cocked. Shout out to John Castle for winning the dead pool backstage. He guessed Scanlan Two correctly. Question for the DM: Before, when I was watching him shove the Pelor trammel in, did it look like it took a lot of muscle, specifically, to get it in there?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"That brings us to Vax. Goddamn. I don't know what to do, man. I pull out the trammel. Do you have a free hand? Or a belt? Yeah, you've got a belt. Do I have a free hand? Your hand would be open. You had the sword out right now in the other hand. So no free hand. Can I use the hasted action to shove my trammel into his belt? Or into the bag of holding? Or anywhere? I'll let you do that as a hasted action. The Raven Queen's trammel. I did a",perception check and got a 28.
Athletics,"Grog. I'm going to see Arkhan. I'm going to see my friend Scanlan. And then I'm going to dig into Vecna's eye and stab away. Don't do too much damage! It's too late. What? It's not too late. Retcon that shit. You haven't rolled a thing. No? No. He just told us. I will use it to grapple. Okay. So make an acrobatics or athletics check. Should I reroll? Actually, for grapple, it may just be",athletics. Let me double-check here.

Athletics,"here and fucking hug Vecna's face. All right. That brings us to the 20. The buildings shift back once more across the ground. These begin to rotate and spread outward this way. That one merely stays where it is. At this point in time, Arkhan? So we don't want to do any more damage? No. All right. I'm going to attempt to grapple his arm with that hand on it. Okay. That's good. That's a natural 19. What would I add? Proficiency plus strength? This would be, on a grapple? That's",athletics check.

Athletics,"Spent your turn, yeah. Is there a way to pull him down? Not at this size and the fact that you're flying there  he's too big. All right. Then I'm going to hang. Just going to grapple. That brings us to Keyleth. What you got, girl? Can you grapple him? Grapple and pull him down. Okay. Yeah. I'll take the other side that Arkhan has not. Grab the other side of him and try and grapple him, leaving him open and available for Scanlan.",MATT: Make an athletics check.

Right, and she sees you standing there, ready to go, and she's like, ""No, please, please!"" You threaten me all the time! Yeah, but she doesn't have any weapons on her! Neither do I! Actually, do you want to see if she has any weapons? Oh, well I'm very perceptive, Grog. You know that. Oh, you are perceptive. Right. Roll a",perception check.
Stealth,"Yeah, it's like, you know, a blue denim. Yeah. So you see at her side this spear that's laying up against the table. Yeah, yeah. I don't know how you missed it the first time. It's a fucking spear, right there. She stands up and she's like, ""No, no, please! No more eye-poking!"" Grog, Grog! I'm going to try to turn invisible, if that's all right. Can I just do that? I don't know. Can you just do that, or do you roll? I normally just do that. Okay. Go invisible. All right, I'm going to go invisible and I'm going to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it.",TRAVIS: Okay. Roll a stealth check.
Perception,"her little bundle, and they start to make their way out of the tavern. I grab the spear. You do? Yes. They didn't take it, so I will take it now. It's my spear. That's terrible! They do seem suspicious. Can I read their lips on the way out? Are they talking? Can I read their lips? Sure. What are they saying? Roll a d20. Everybody seems to know what's going on. Am I adding anything to it?",TRAVIS: Perception. Do a perception check.
Perception,"Yes, we would. You find it. Fuck, it's right there. Good job. Right, so you lift the latch in the floor and you go down. It's a very small room that has different salted meats and cheeses, and some bread and stuff like that. This cellar has better food than your mansion. We take it all. You take armfuls? After a little bit. I mean, do you want to see maybe what else is down there? Yeah, let's see what else is down there.",TRAVIS: Roll perception checks.
Perception,"Yeah, I'll grab it. All right. So you hop onto your broom, kick up off the ground and grab the torch. You pull it out and off in the distance somewhere, you hear a scraping sound. Very faint, but you hear it. What strange intelligence would have gone through this hall and lit torches that were eight to ten feet off the ground? That's very particular. You have that special sense! Try to sense if there's any flagons around? Yeah, I'm going to try to sense if there's any flagons. Big ones, with wings.",TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.

So that we're quiet. Can I hide? Yeah. I can? I'm going to hide. Do your thingy, though. Yeah. Everybody please roll a stealth check. You don't have to clap or-- I've already cast it. I cast it already,",but roll a stealth check.
Perception,"arrow. And your sight goes (zooming) and you see it fly approximately (counting) 25 feet and it just hits another wall made of stone in the cavern, very similar to the one you're in. It looks the exact same? Yeah, almost identical to this one. Jeez, Grog, you're inspired today. This is very impressive. Come on, even in this imaginary game, we're invincible heroes of justice. Let's just go look! Can we see forward? Can we see? Well, hold on. We know that I like to stick my dick into things, so why don't I creep ahead and see what is happening?",TRAVIS: Very smart. Make a perception check.

Watch for traps! You don't want to explode, I don't know what Grog has set up for us. I'll roll this one with the book on it because I feel goodness from it. I got a 19 on that, plus perception. Oh my gosh, that's really good. 33 for perception. You open your eyes, and because you're staring at the wall like a nerd, you notice the mortar is very fine.

Perception,"hatch, and it's solid iron, with rusted-- There's water dripping out of it. And you see there is a chute indeed. No light coming from it. It's bars? Bars, but it looks as if it goes straight up, and up, and up. Is it closed off? It is. It's closed very securely. Can I try to pull them? May I turn around from the wall first? You may, yes. There you go. Can I use some sort of perception or insight or one of these numbers to figure out if we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls?",TRAVIS: You may. Roll a perception check.
Investigation,"So you are going up. Ooh, this is you! Can I pull on the bars to see if I can get out? Yeah, you pull on it, and, man, that shit is-- Roll a strength check. I'll give you a shot. Because I'm really strong, Grog. Nine. No, no. It doesn't even move. It doesn't even do the pothole thing. As soon as you step on it, it goes boop boop, I'm going to fall. But no, it's solid. Is there a lock to be seen? Not that you can tell. If you want to check and see if there's a latch to it. I want to look and see.",TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.
Medicine,"You take 13 points of fucking dart damage. Is that a lot? Is that all you have? I assume not. I assume I'm okay. You look at the wound in his cheek, and the wound in his arm, chest area, they don't seem so bad, but the one in his butt is starting to swell a little bit. Kind of bruised and red. Yeah, you should definitely suck the poison out. I definitely should. Or I could use my paladin ability-- No, you should just suck it out. I pull down my pants.",TRAVIS: Make a medicine check as you suck on
Acrobatics,"I like to evade stuff like this, can I use some sort of evasion? Unfortunately, no. Strength check? I knew this was what this game would be. I knew it. Yeah, a strength check? Oh gosh. I'm not very strong, Grog. Ooh! 22! That's enough, because Vax doesn't have very many muscles. So you pull him off the plate, and he's there, all of you are right there, ready to go again. What about Trinket? And Grog? All right. Yeah, hold on. Look, Grog makes it over, and then Trinket comes up. Roll a",acrobatics check for Trinket.
Perception,"acrobatics check for Trinket. Grog, I didn't see anything hit you, but I might better just suck poison out of your ass, just to be sure. You know what, save it for later. I'm going to say that's a 14 for Trinket. Ooh, yeah, so unfortunately-- Grog, save him as he falls! Sure. So he falls and I start to hear the grinding again and I pull him by his ear, and whoop, everybody's on the safe side of the trap. What would you like to do next? I would like to see if there are any more traps before we get to the tip.",TRAVIS: Roll a perception check.
Acrobatics,"But he is right there. Can he continue his attack? Probably not. Can I attack with my second arrow? No. Vax, you're up. I will run at the ghost. Right? Because I have to get up to it. I could throw, but where's the fun in that? So I run at the ghost, and I'm going to use Whisper, and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger. And I'm going to use the power of my deity and do something called Divine Smiting. I've never told you guys what it's called, but it's called Divine Smite.","TRAVIS: Well, give me an acrobatics check,"
Perception,"Yeah, do it. Ooh, that's lovely. That's ten points of damage, plus six points of psychic damage, plus four points of electricity. That is just enough. You hit him, and his form-- You hear this shriek, and he just-- turns into a puff of smoke. Disappears into nowhere, and the ghost is gone. Calm retakes the hallway. Back towards the tip. Yes, musicians, calm down. Let's refocus on the shaft. I'm going to peruse the rest of the--",TRAVIS: Make a perception check to explore the

There's a fountain right in front of you, and as you go in, you see there appears to be like, just this rouge, flushed-skin type water coming out of it. Some sort of fluid. And it's just a beautiful fountain, right in the middle of the room. Circular, from what you can see. What do you do? Where was the furry creature?

I found 20 platinum in this secret passage."" Oh my god. Can I see some platinum too? Can I go over there? Platinum's mine, but you never know what else is around. Maybe look for yourself.

So you push and there seems to be something coiled up on the ground in the corner. Is it a monster or is it platinum? It's not a creature or anything. Do you want it or not? Does it look like platinum? Could be. Okay. Can I look at it?",TRAVIS: Yeah. Roll a perception check.
Investigation,"You want to search the bottom of each fountain? Yeah. Sure. Like feel around, see if there's any loot. Which one would you like to start on? Scanlan's or--? Well there's one right behind me. Yeah, sure. I should do the one closest to me. There you go. I'm going to see if there's any traps in there if I'm going to stick my hand deep into that thing.","TRAVIS: Yeah, roll an investigation check."

Which really just adds more bacteria to it. I will inspect the door.",TRAVIS: Make a perception check.

I'd like to go investigate that door. All right. Yes. So, you go over and find this open door. And as you look, there is a symbol above the doorway. It seems to be the symbol of a star. And the door is open. Would you like to investigate? I would like to investigate.",TRAVIS: Roll an investigation check.

Deception,"the same evening. It's incredibly inconvenient. ""I hate being troubled twice in the same evening."" If we may, this sweet girl here was also part of our party and she is quite the protective one. I'm afraid that she was also providing aid to our fellows in that tent. I'm afraid her younger sister was attacked in a similar way. I feel it's only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to protect this young dwarven girl that performed in the circus. She means no harm. It was an adopted sister. I practically raised her. It's a sensitive subject.",MATT: Okay. I would like a deception check.
Insight,"that's what we're going to do. Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm. Thank God. Okay. Let's get a drink. Thank gods. We head downstairs. You guys head down. You get to the bottom of the stairs just in time to see Jester, Beauregard, Molly, and Fjord looking across the tavern, making their way in your direction, and you guys notice them meeting you in the tavern room, as well. Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed you! Somehow we got separated! Friends. That happens, yes.",MARISHA: Can I insight check him?
Investigation,"with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But really it's my fault  it's not him. He's a smart man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of his tricks are phenomenal, really. No, I'd love to. I feel bad to because we never stay in one place long enough for him to have a decent shower. (laughter) It's a moving story. I immediately check my pockets after that to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything still there, all my coin?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Sleight of Hand,"Yeah. What's on your waist? I'm looking at her waist. What's on her waist? What's on your waist? My symbol to the Traveler. Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek pocket and fish around. I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my buttcheek. But you can try. What pockets do you have? I would have pockets on the front of my dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip. I'll do the hip pocket.","MATT: All right, make a sleight of hand check."
Perception,"But this is free money, that you don't have to work for. Also, you know, they basically helped us out today. You can do it for one, for them. All right, one gold. One gold. That's a really good deal. Did you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay! Do you give him the gold? Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let me make sure I have it. Where's my--? It's the second button. Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down. Do I notice anything shifty about that, while we were looking at his hands?",MATT: Perception check.
Medicine,"me know. We've seen that window thing a couple times. It's good. Can I request a display? I think I have a broken rib. It might be getting more purple. Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm tapped. I'll sleep it off, it's fine. Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got nothing. It's not happening. It's past midnight! Oh, no. I've got to sleep. You concentrate for a moment. Make a",medicine check.
Perception,"much, I'll accept it. You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be scared, come up to me. Okay. Okay, in what order are you leaving? Should I go first? Sure! Are we going out in pairs? Like you said? (Deeper) Are we going out in pairs? Has Adelaine noticed any of this? I imagine you guys have been using your disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers. Other than that, no one immediately seems to be",noticing. Make a perception check.
Performance,"14! 14, thank you. You do see Yorda, the barkeep, in the process of wiping out some glasses at the end, she's occasionally giving a glance over to you guys as you're walking around. (whispering) You go first! You want to come with? Yeah. Don't do anything stupid. Mouth shut, eyes forward. Show me how you walk. Maybe a little less. That's nice. I also assume a little limp, slight. I'll say for the purpose of this, each of",you make a performance check.
Investigation,"him, if a friend has died at the circus last night. I mean, you mentioned no sick people. If he was sick, sometimes that word gets around. Maybe there is a morgue, maybe they recognized him. These small towns, most everyone knows everybody else. Let's go to, is there a market area? They don't have a large bazaar, but there is an area that is generally where a lot of the simple wares and vegetables and meats and people who sell small things that they craft their own at, it's a small market. If you want to make an",investigation check.
Deception,"""looking for drinks? Can I get you anything?"" Yeah, I would really love a drink and I sit down next to him. What do you have? I need something heavier than a trost. I've had enough trosts to last me a lifetime. ""We have liquor."" I will take your liquor. ""I will get some whiskey for you then. Whiskey, everyone?"" Sure. Two please. It's okay. She's my daughter. She loves whiskey. I don't even remember what voice I was doing. (laughing)",MATT: Make a deception check.
Investigation,"35 years ago, but he got married and went up ""north."" Did he work for any of the particular breweries around? ""I don't know. Maybe."" Brinjay. Where did he sit in here? He points over to the not the table the guy is playing solitaire on, but the empty table to the right of him. ""Usually right there in the corner."" I go sit in the corner. I'm going to look for anything I can find that looks like an old man was touching it.","MATT: Okay, make an investigation check."
Perception,"against the horizon. You see a couple of small landmasses in the center of the loch, that are barely out of view. You approach, and the first couple of fishermen that walk past you both look to be hardened in their years. Their skin is very battered by the sun, it's wrinkled and dark from constant beating of the sky upon them. They glance over at this unique-looking troupe as they approach. They stop and don't say anything, they just look at you like ""What are you doing here?"" Do we still have Disguise Self up? You have it for maybe ten more minutes. Oh shit. Do we see any King's Guard? Crownsguard?",MATT: Crownsguard? Make a perception check.
Nature,"If you see any zombies, please let us know. ""I will. You were so kind to help me when I saw a snake, I figure if I see a zombie, you'd ""also be helpful."" We would, definitely. We already killed a zombie too! This is just a snake. This is a big, weird snake I'm looking at? You can inspect it if you want. No, I've been looking at the snake this entire time. Oh, we have one of its fangs. I pulled it out.",MATT: Make a nature check.
Investigation,"standard! Hey kiddo, do you want a piggy-back? Sure, that sounds like a good idea. Scramble up, let's go talk to some people. All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back. All right. I'll wander down to where people are working. Where people are moving crates around. He's on Caleb's back! Okay, that would be probably closer to the Northward. Okay, so that's the plan, is to look for people moving crap around, the same way that Enon is said to have. So that's what we'll do.","MATT: Okay, make an investigation check."
Investigation,"here, books included. This is just things you've collected throughout your lifetime? ""Right. Boughten, traded for, found."" I don't know what you just said, but I am interested in books. Particularly in the arcane realm, but any kind of book. Do you have anything that you just outright know is out of the ordinary? ""I'm sure we've got a few. Look around! See what you find. It's half the fun, half the ""journey."" All right, friend, let's-- It's like Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the shelves.",MATT: Make an investigation check.

All right, friend, let's-- It's like Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the shelves. Make an investigation check. Can you give me something to look for?

Sleight of Hand,"""Of course. Sorry about your cat, friend."" It's okay. Nott? Have I heard all of this conversation? You've been hearing all of it, but you've also found, amongst the chaos, a brass baby bottle that's fairly dented, but it's very shiny and polished, you can already see on the inside. You find a new flask, actually. It's very tarnished, but you spit and rub it a little bit. It looks to be of very fine metallic material. You're not entirely sure, you'd have to clean it, but it looks like very nice quality material. All right. I'll try to trade my flask with that flask.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
Sleight of Hand,"Now, your flask, which still has liquor in it, is left behind for the empty flask you receive. However, without an instance of anyone even paying attention. It is yours. You can write in your inventory you are now the owner of a platinum flask. Ooh! Shit! Okay! It's a baby bottle, or maybe a rattle? What'd you say? Baby bottle. Looks like it was used as a bottle for a very upper-class family. You're already so ahead, though! I know. But I can't resist. I'll try to take one more look and pocket that as well.","MATT: Make another sleight of hand check, please."
Stealth,"intersections of the street are lit. Other than that, you have a faint bit of moonlight that's coming through the sky. There are some clouds, but they're a bit broken up, so every now and then the moon cover can vanish and then return, but for now you have moonlight in the city. Where are you guys going? Towards the north end. I ought to be leading the way, I reckon. Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three cloaked figures. A little ways north of Natural Remedies? Okay. I would like everybody to make a stealth check, please.",SAM: Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing?
Perception,"Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord. Let's not spread out too far, though. Are you two like an item? What? You and Fjord, are you like a thing? Why, are you interested in him? No, ugh, no! No? You travel together. Well yeah, he's a good friend. He watches out for me, I watch out for him, you know. We're a good team. Like you and Caleb. Not at all like that, but yes, all right. As you guys fan out a little bit, everyone",make a perception check.
Performance,"from the inn? From the inn? About a 15 minute jog. So we can go to the circus? An hour and a half. While we're still trying to figure this out, I'm going to take out my painter's kit and draw like a little piece of poop on the side of the building that we're next to. Tagging? That's good. A little tagger. Is it like a mound of poop or like a single--? No it's like a mound of poop. It's like an emoji.",MATT: Make a performance check.
Stealth,"draw a pile of poop next to it. It helps, but-- That's a triangle. Yeah, I thought it was like chocolate frozen yogurt. Is math or something? It's dark okay?! I can usually paint much better than this. It's really dark and my hands feel a little numb. Let's move then. Who's going where? What are you guys doing? We're all going to the circus. Stealthily to the circus. All right, I would like for all of you to",roll a stealth check.
Deception,"Anywhere to hide? There are some small alcoves, but you guys are out in the open, now. They've seen you. All of us? You don't know. They've seen you. They've called to you, and then both of you guys disguised yourselves. What are you doing? I walk into the lake and crouch down?

This one is mine, thank you. Beat her within an inch of her life.",MATT: I need you to make a deception check on that
Religion,"You make your way inside, the smell is pretty bad. You can smell the flesh beginning to decay. Have they moved the bodies or are the bodies still there? With a bit of looking, the bodies are still there where they left them. They have not moved, you can see a couple of remnants of notes and sheets that have been crumpled, but the bodies have been left where they are. Can we check the bodies for anything? Is there anything arcane? From all my studies, does anything here ring any bell? I have a photographic memory.",MATT: Go and make a religion check.
Investigation,"Is there anything arcane? From all my studies, does anything here ring any bell? I have a photographic memory. Go and make a religion check. All right. That is a ten. Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of research on the undead, or whatever might be the essence of this creature's creation, and the more you look at it, you're like, ""This is not my specialty."" Okay. What about the perimeters of here, where all the people were? There was a swarm of people. I spend five minutes seeing anything was dropped of interest.","MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you."
Religion,"dropped of interest. Make an investigation check, both of you. That's better. I miss the twins. 16. Big ten. Glancing about, you can see the track marks of everyone fleeing. You can see the spatters of blood. You can see the place where the transformation occurred. There is a horrible shedding of certain layers of flesh. You can see previously existing layers of flesh and muscle that were shed as whatever this undead thing was fell to the ground. Once again, you make a",religion check as well.
Stealth,"ground zero one, which is where you were putting all your attention, and then there's the woman, who was transformed as part of the first. I will take my dagger, and I will slice a little bit off of the woman, and it's going to get dark in here and I will snuff out the light and use the rag to roll it up and I'll put the little piece in my pack.

Stealth,"Not yet. If you want to ask them something you can. Do they look nervous or are they just being shifty? Make an insight check to find out. Yeah. While she's doing that I'm going to try and sneak out the underside of the tent to go to the big tent. I'll go with her. This is a bit of a leap.

Persuasion,"that sees me. Okay. As he stands up, he goes toward you and he goes for his blade and he has to make a saving throw. Oh boy. Which he does not make. I don't think so, it's like a six. No, it's like 13 or something. Yeah. So he goes like-- Hi, I'm not here. ""Okay."" Okay. Sit down. Go to sleep, this is a dream.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"giant, scaly, somewhat oily exterior of the body. That's why you detected him, because he's a fiend. Maybe he's a good fiend, can fiends be good? I don't know, you detected-- Is he still sleeping? (snoring) He's still sleeping. We can wake him up and ask? And ask if he's good or bad? Yeah? Eh. Is anyone else in the tent?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Deception,"situation, just separately. Not really. I don't want to compare myself to you, because that would be rude. The two halfling twins look at each other, and back at you. Her name's Beau. She's helping, she's awful, you have a lot in common. ""Okay, well, I mean, whatever you want to know."" He's such a dick. Why is he such a dick? ""Molly's great, why are you such a dick?"" Reversal!

Insight,"We've talked to Toya. She knows it's you who did this! We know you guys are in a fight all the time. You're the one behind the whole plot! You did it! You!

Athletics,"Cut them down with those guns. Is that fire still going? It's not a huge blaze, but there's some flames in it. It's starting to burn out a little bit. Both barrels. Six shooter. Give it to them. Okay. With my initial attack as I run up, can I take my staff and try and take them out at the knees? Just a sweep? Sure. I'd say go ahead and make an athletics check. Knock them prone? Yeah, that's what I'm going for.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Medicine,"Well, congratulations, you're the cleric now. (gasps) You have a healer's kit? Oh my gosh. I've always wanted one of these for so long. I'll give it to her. Here, it's a gift. Congratulations-on-you-being-in-a-new group gift. Yes! How do I use this, though? Oh no, she's not proficient. I open it and rummage through a bunch of shit here. No vanilla extract or sprinkles?

Perception,"Yes. What if I roll a one on it? That's what I'm hoping for. That's a strong four. A nine? Okay, I'll say-- (sighs). He's still unconscious. Given a little bit of time, he'll come back to consciousness. Ten minutes or so. You can probably, eventually through the use of strong vapors or something you can bring him back from the brink. At this point the rest of the carnival currently within the vicinity begin to emerge from the tents seeing that the danger has passed. Is there any young girl in the tent with me?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Religion,"has blackened, charcoal edges to it. Nott, you feel Frumpkin's claws slowly and deliberately squeeze into your shoulder. That means I have to go. Where's Caleb? I thought he was with you. He was. I look around for Caleb. Okay. If you're right there, you're not far from the tent. You head back and see he's not on the outside of the tent.

We better fucking get that. Sure. It's not a mare? I'm just checking. No, no it is. I'm just very curious as to the sex of the horse, that's all.",MATT: Roll a perception check.
Perception,"How did we never know that? That was established in the last campaign. Like dogs, we never looked up. One of the moons is so faint-- How many suns are there? There's one. Anyway, there's a faint bit of moonlight which gives you folks without darkvision a little bit of detail that you can make out in the vicinity. You come to the lake edge and there's the water. This is the best we can do for them. Take them out of this wagon! Hang on, hang on. I want to look around. Do I see any guards?",MATT: Perception check.
Survival,"one of their pockets that says something like ""I've discovered that Caleb and Nott are innocent and should be cleared of all charges"", or something like that. That would definitely work. Will you add my name to that list? Sure. How do you spell Jester? Like normal. Okay. Maybe we can dump them, backtrack with the cart, and drop the cart back off. As we've been riding, have we seen any tracks that we think might have belonged to the toad? Since it was leaping in these huge arcs.",MATT: Make a survival check.
Survival,"Yes, kick them out. Okay, so you remove the bodies from the cart. Are you dumping them on the shoreline? Yeah. Okay. (thud, thud) The two transformed guard corpses now lie there. One an ashy mess, the other in three pieces. Left along the bank of the water. I get out and I start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst. Those two burnt men? Yes. Okay. (laughs) I'm going to help Jester try and clear the tracks while she positions bodies.",MATT: Make a survival check.
Survival,"No, a little bit further away and then has hit the land. The figures are currently taking things out of the boat. They're late night fishermen. I think they're fishermen. Let's keep moving. Okay, which direction are you moving? North. Well, north is into the water. Like you hit the water of the bottom of the lake. The toad went due north? Like straight into the water? That's the direction it was traveling. Can I look for toad tracks?","MATT: Make a survival check, sure."
Investigation,"Oh, Sam. That was a lot. That was a whole lot of rolls. Survival. 11. 11. It's hard to really make out what tracks are what. You do see a few heavy impacts in the mud. Some of them looks like it could have been the bodies being rolled, but not too far from where you are, there's one big smack in the mud. Like something heavy impacted. Fjord! Come look at this! This is definitely toad tracks. In the shape that it's in, this print. Are their toes pointing in a specific direction?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Survival,"Yeah, I'm going to do both of those. I changed my mind, I believe I used arcane recovery during the day. So forget it. Yeah, it's gone. You can hit dice it. I bet you have a thing where you can click it on. Now I'm at 12 hit points. That's better, there you go. 12? Better than one. Yay 12 hit points.

Animal Handling,"So what are you doing? We're taking the cart back to a distance from the city. Half a mile. Yeah, and then letting the horses run, so the-- sending the track off. I see. Okay. I don't think we would have gone right past the fishermen that would be able to identify us. Using the lake to hide tracks.

Drops a couple of horse apples. I didn't get advantage on that because I knew the animals, did I? No. You knew the animals, but you weren't the animal handler. I use Thaumaturgy and I make the sound of like a predator behind them.",MATT: Okay. I'll give you an animal handling check

With a crack, and a heavy echoing snarling sound in the vicinity, both horses kick up and go into a full gallop sprint away from the direction of you, the cart being dragged behind it. They continue to go into the shadow. You don't know how long they're going to go. I cast Thaumaturgy! (quacks) By the time you guys make it back to the inn-- Those ducks are scary! Are you guys being careful, or are you just walking back? We're being careful.","MATT: I'd like you all to roll a stealth check,"
Religion,"sound of song? It does not. Is it related at all to the periwinkles you were talking about before? It's not possible he's trying to head back to Xhorhas, is it? I said out loud. I think we saw both the fast and the slow feeding methods. Kylre was not a talker. Does it say how to kill it? Yeah, weaknesses? Vulnerabilities? Stabbing? Well, most fiends are weak to holy damage, right?",MATT: Make a religion check.
Deception,"at the front, there's now three, and there are two guards stationed across the street that are keeping a watch. It looks like everyone's on high alert since they've had some of their own crownsguard killed. You make your way around the corner, through the T-intersection to the other road that meets with the main street that crosses in front of the Nestled Nook, and you see the guard stationed outside who's currently leaning up against the wall, arms crossed, looking back and forth. Can I run up to him and say: (old raspy voice) You, please, over here! I've seen one of those creatures! It's tearing into him and it's horrible. Please, come quickly!",MATT: Make a deception check.

I'm drinking tons of whiskey because I'm super scared to be on the water. Eight. 13. 20. Okay. For future note, if everyone's going","to make a perception check I may have a few folks,"
Deception,"That's big. As you approach the bank, you can see already there's a lot of heavy rocks. This is not a soft, muddy embankment like the outskirts of the lake. This has a lot of jagged rock, and your ship-finding friend is carefully making his way through as close as he can before he comes to a stop, pushes off with an oar, and says, ""All right, I think this is as close as I can get. What ""are you doing here, if I might ask?"" We are going to have a picnic on the island. Beach party. Nighttime beach party!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Investigation,"We'll return. All right. As you guys step off the boat into about ankle-deep water, traversing the broken bits of sharpened stone, making your way to the actual island of Crookedstone, you begin to slowly approach the outside of the treeline.

Look down, and see if now that I have him flying closer, maybe I can see better, or see something moving in this dim light, before it goes?","MATT: Perception check on Frumpkin, please."
Perception,"Roll really good. With disadvantage because of the lack of light. Balls. That's a big seven. We're lowly humans. How did you deal with this? It was awful. I let all of you go first everywhere. Yeah, the lack of detail, nothing really catches Frumpkin's eye from above. It's too dark. (flutters) Can I look and see if I see any big broken branches, or sign of something big moving through the forest?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"catches Frumpkin's eye from above. It's too dark. (flutters) Can I look and see if I see any big broken branches, or sign of something big moving through the forest? Make a perception check. Perception? Not investigation? Are you glancing about, or are you going to wade through the forest to look for things? No ranger.

Perception,"Stop burping! Yes you did! I didn't burp! You probably just breathed out hard. I'm sorry, it was me. That was you?! No, I meant Caleb's stink. I have not burped. I'm trying to keep an eye out for anything. Unfortunately, you're having a hard time to make out any sign. You guys make your way towards the center of this cluster of trees. As we walk, Fjord and I will keep a lookout for any more crustacean empty shells.","MATT: Okay. Make a perception check. Well, one of"
Perception,"Can we sneak around the ruin? We're building a narrative here that Matt is not giving us. Like The Secret. You're manifesting a witch fight here. ""Where's the hut?"" Let's approach. You guys approach. Who's keeping visual point on this? Who's got better eyes? I have darkvision. I'm moving slow on purpose at the back of the group now. Which means you are, too. Who's helming this? I'll give one of you a",perception roll to help on this.
Acrobatics,"Ah, wow. Then as me, I'm going to run away. Can I run behind a tree and crouch? You can go around this one there. I'm going to crouch behind it. That gives you some cover. That's your turn. Beau, you're up. That's my turn. I'm going to vault off of the platform that I'm on, and I'm going to go for Toya. I'm going to take my bo staff.

Grapple her down.","MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check,"
Athletics,"As you run and dart, you see the giant arm coming down towards you, and you pull the shield up and it almost causes you to trip from the sheer force of the impact. But the brunt of it is taken by the shield as it scrapes off and you hear this horrible grinding of metal as its claws scoop across the outside of it. That ends your turn I believe. Beau. Okay, so I've got the little girl pinned, and I am going to go, shh. I am going to take my arm and-- Are you trying to cover her mouth? Yep. Okay. Go ahead and make an additional",athletics check.

Fjord, I need you to make a death saving throw. It's been a long time since you've had to make one of these in the game. Three. That's a fail. All righty. Is that your first fail? Top of the round. The imp-- I'm going to",make a perception check for that imp. That's not
Medicine,"All right, so the first attack crushes the imp and it hits the ground, the wings go limp and it's dead, but you still (yells) and stomp down, just crushing it more and more. And then its body eventually just burns away into ash. So all the threats have been neutralised and you now have two friends that are bleeding out. Okay, then I'm going to run over to Fjord and cast Cure Wounds on him so he wakes up. You come back to consciousness. With five hit points. I will try to stabilise Caleb using no-- Caleb, I need you to make a death save. Death save? Fail.",MATT: All righty. Make a medicine check.

She starts trying to fight your grasp. I'll explain it later. She's going to try and break free of your grasp. Are you going to attempt to hold onto her? Oh, yeah.

You are young. Sometimes people we feel we know can be someone else. Regrettably, this is one of those instances. He was a dangerous thing. It is very important that this is buried here.

""No. They took over my boat and forced me to take them to the middle island there."" You will not take credit for my kill. I have killed this thing and I want it to be watched.

Persuasion,"(laughter) Funny story. Yes, these are the people I was talking about. Nothing has changed, however, and I am only asking to take another ten minutes of your time to walk to the dock.

So I staked out the circus this evening, and watched as this toad thing left the grounds there. It did this to me, and I, in a rage, followed it and destroyed it, and I will show you the remains of my work. We'll put it to bed. I'm either a clown or I'm a toad-killer.

Perception,"traders, not traitors. He can't hear you. Do you see, are they carrying money? Are they carrying people? He won't be able to talk to you for a while. You see, he's not really there. Coming closer down the road now, the gap between your traveling troupe and this caravan grows smaller and smaller. All the rest of you, I'd like to make a perception check, please. I think at this point, Frumpkin has-- I would've released it, yeah. He's not back, but I released the sight. 17.",LIAM: Perception check?
Perception,"""Uh..."" At this point he's passed by you and his voice gets a bit louder over his shoulder and he's like, ""From this point, it's probably around 150 miles."" Thank you! The next one continues, one after another. You get a better look, too. The ones at the front that were pretty heavily covered, as opposed to the ones in the back which are a little taller, and as you look into the back, there's little flaps and openings on the inside, you can see there's families traveling. Does it look like they have any wares that they're traveling to trade?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"merchants are bringing their family with them for long treks, so they're not apart from them for so long, or their family is just a family of traders or transport. Looking past them, you can see there are a lot of supplies behind them, but you're not sure if they're wares or just their personal goods. Molly, feel like making some coin, doing a little bit of a show? Hmm. The fifth cart's now passed. You're moving on to the sixth cart. Do these people look like they're in the mood to stop? Yeah, do they look sad?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Perception,"(fake cough) Beau. Yeah, I'll take watch. Oh, sorry. Okay. Beau and who else? So generous of you. You want to do it? I was going to say, yeah. I'll take a round. I'm used to keeping an eye out on the road. So the two of you are taking point up until you guys decide to change it when it comes to travel along the road. It's just general perception? Yes. I would like you both, currently about an hour's journey past that intersection with the","other caravan, to make a perception check."
Perception,"We were shitting in the bushes. A ladybug lands on his nose and goes in his nostril, but he can't feel it. Feel it?! I can feel stuff! Maybe not this. You're too focused. We worked out that he could-- okay, great. There's bugs in my nose. It tickles a little bit. Shove it all in, everybody! To be fair, your face itches in general from the sheer amount of filth that's on it. It's hard to really differentiate. In the middle of the field you hear: Ooh, look at that! What do I see?",MATT: Make a perception check for your birdie.
Investigation,"Okay. I keep flying for a little bit longer. Okay. I lift Beau up to the branch just because. Okay. Feels like childhood. Do you want up here? Yeah, I'll jump! All right, I lift her up. We sit up in the branches. Okay, cool. It's a nice view. (laughter) It's impossible to believe him. Is there anything carved in the branches, in the tree trunk?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"What if it's nothing? Then they'll be upset with us. There's nothing more dangerous than-- I shake Beau awake. No, she's the most irritable! I'm what? Sorry. Did you say I'm fucking irritable? She said ""most beautiful."" There's a thing out there in the field. Something is moving. She can't see! She's human, too! (laughter) I'm going to go look! I can see in the dark. No, wait here! I'm going to dart off in a flanking maneuver.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"12. 11. 16. All right. The four of you, shoulder to shoulder, keeping low, making your way through the field, stepping ever so carefully. And there's this (croaking) as one of you accidentally goes completely foot down on to some sort of field frog that had been there. As the croak hits, you watch as one of the creatures (startled grunting), and they all start running away, spooked by the sound. Shit. Can we tell what they are? Now that we're closer?","MATT: Make a perception check, if you want to."
Perception,"It's vaguely what I imagine a buffalo would look like. Yeah. Sorry. That was fun, let's go. Back to sleep. Silently ruffle Nott's hair on the way back to camp. Stop it. (singing) Who's got the third watch? I'll take it. Turd watch. All right. Molly has the third watch. Turd watch.","MATT: Perception check, please."
Insight,"water on his chest really quickly and (sniffing). It's briny and salty. Huh. Why are you drinking salt water? You don't know that. Oh. (in Sam's voice) Why are you drinking salt water? (laughter) Jeez, Fjord. That's a lot of drool. Does it taste like stomach acid? Because that's gross, man. Only one way to find out! Like a momma bird. Everybody have some of what I puked up. It's all good.","LIAM: I don't, I want to make an insight check."

He's talking about acid reflux but he just spit a bunch of water out.","MATT: Yeah, make an insight check."
Insight,"Could we revisit that idea, perhaps? I'm sorry, the night has left me a bit shaken, and I feel like I need a moment to get my bearings, if that's all right. Ja, you can understand that we would be curious, but I don't want to push anybody. I mean, we've just met. Of course not, and I don't want to make anyone feel uneasy. Again, trying to be as transparent as I can. I don't quite understand, and I appreciate your patience in advance. And I make it vanish. You watch as it just disappears out of your grip. When he says he doesn't quite understand, is",he telling the truth? Is that the same insight check?
Perception,"and there? No. They're small and waist high, and shoulder high walls that are partitions here and there, but it's largely a farming city. Not fortified at all? No, not at all. Is he within range to hit with a spell? No, he's about-- well, depends on the spell. Right now he's about 200 feet from you and he's running into the city. You can see the flames are further in but you can see the orange glow flickering in the distance. Can I do a quick scan and see if I see more?",MATT: Perception check.
Stealth,"figures silhouetted by flames, and other bits of light that normally fill the streets in the center of the city. Most you can see are these up here and you can already see a few bodies of guards and civilians that are lying on the ground, carved open and not moving. You see spatters of blood. You still hear them barking and giving orders next to each other (rabid barking). How far away are the ones on the roof? How long is the distance from us? Over here? At this distance it's hard to say. I'd say probably in the neighborhood of about 70 to 80 feet from you. You guys, I would like, if you are trying to stay out of sight, make a","stealth check, please. Those of you with a point"
Performance,"up and darting over the way. They're preparing for some sort of... whatever's coming. But first of the round is you, Beau. I turn to Nott. Huh!? Hey, you want to take these guys? You ready for this? (panicked stuttering) I'm going to drink from my flask. Get ready. I want them to come to this window, okay? I'm going to go (whistles) through the window. Try and get their attention. Okay. Right there?",MATT: Make a performance check.
Athletics,"process of slamming through the front doorway, the doorway has been bashed inward on each side and Beau is in the process of dodging and weaving and getting out of the way. You find one opening and fire your crossbow bolt. It goes through the window, through the doorway bisecting the two different rooms and straight under the clavicle near the heart section of it. As it pierces in, (screams) and it coughs up a bunch of blood onto the front of its hide armor. It's not dead, but it's pretty hurt. That was a pretty nasty blow. Movement, I will use to climb up into the second floor window. That's not me. The one next to your right. There you go.",MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Acrobatics,"pressing into you. There's a table that's on fire, most of the roof has been burned away. There's beams that have fallen. You're like, ""This was a ""bad idea!"" I say: This is fine! (laughter) Can I use my dash? Was that all my movement? No, that was your movement to get up there and you could use your bonus action if you'd like to. Okay, I'll use a bonus action to get-- Is towards the window less fiery? It's still burning, but you're going to have to leap over the flames to get there. Sure.",MATT: I'll say make an acrobatics check to try and
Athletics,"It is plus five. That's a 20. Sorry, plus four. That's a 19. 19 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll 1d6 damage plus two. Two hands technically, so that would be 1d8. Sorry. Yeah, that's much better. Nine. Nine. Nein! It jams the spear with both hands into its friend and the gnoll yelps and grabs it and pulls it out and looks at it confused and angry. Trying to figure out what exactly happened. As it does so, it's going to attempt to shove it off the wall that just hit it. Make a roll for the",athletics check of the other gnoll.
Perception,"Then I use the rest of my movement to press my back against the wall and go nein, nein, nein. As you move out, where are you at now? Still behind the same building. You dart out and fire, and then back. All righty. That ends your turn. Nott! Just a little perspective here. The gnolls pushing away the cart, how many are there? And what are they--? There are currently three that are gathered around it and in the process of pushing it. They're getting momentum as it's going. No obvious weak points on the cart or anything?",MATT: Make a perception check. It will take your
Acrobatics,"Well, there's still one left on the ground, which we'll say for the purposes of narrative here, who wants to do this? What, you really want to do something? Is it our turn soon? Caleb and me? Yeah. Well, when we come back around, it would be Molly's turn, Jester, then Caleb and Nott. So whatever you guys want to do in this moment before it comes back, let me know. I would like to jump down from the wall and run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart. Really? Whoa!",MATT: Make an acrobatics check.
Survival,"Oh, shit. With his movement, he puts the bow back away and keeps walking with the rest of the gnolls. I grab Fjord and I say, just wait. Wait. Let them go. You watch as all of them turn around and they all begin to gather. You hear this cacophony of different gibbering cries in the distance as they're all starting to call themselves back to leave the city. They all step into the clouds of smoke and ash in the distance before eventually all the shapes disappear. I want to watch them as far as I can to try and pinpoint a direction that they're heading in.","MATT: Okay, make a survival check in this moment."
Investigation,"I feel really bad for saying that out loud. ""Let's just not let Thadeus know that his life is--"" I have a question. After listening to this for a while, I start looking around the town, would you say that with all these burnt buildings everywhere, that if I start picking through the rubble I would find enough charcoal to reduce the costs I would need for Find Familiar, eventually? Because I still need the incense and the herbs, but if I get a lot of charcoal from these burnt homes-- I will say if you take 30 minutes to find","good pieces of charcoal, and roll an investigation check."
Sleight of Hand,"I'll go in for this if it means a faster breakfast. The two of you jump in with Crute in what is a not very well-kept kitchen, but functional. The gristle, who knows how long it's been there. It might add to the flavor, who knows. A-rating for the city of Los Angeles? We'll put it at a B in Panorama City. Wow, that's an in-joke. You guys go ahead and help out. It does manage to cut down the time for breakfast preparation. Eventually food is presented.

I think they'd be pretty upset about it.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Survival,"scavenged bits of leather and hide armors. But did it have holes for their butts? It seemed like most of them would have had some means of disposing of their excrement. They don't care, they're swinging low and leaving it behind. They weren't very well-dressed. If that's the direction you saw them head off in, check it out. I'll be on the lookout for cart tracks. As we go, and also, we didn't have time, so here, off you go. I will sit in the cart and go blind. Okay. While you are sending Frumpkin to keep a watch, you are keeping an eye out","for tracks. Make a survival check, please."
Survival,"The last one. Okay, can I get like an odd estimate of maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with based on the amount of tracks? With that roll, I'd say you surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 18 or so gnolls. From what you can gather on the tracks that you found. Would my Hunter's Bane be useful for that? For tracking these creatures? You can attempt to glean information. Since they technically have some undead around them? For the specific-- sure. Go ahead and make a",survival check to see if you can even find those tracks.
Perception,"there's a fuckton of them. That's it. Yeah, that is bad news. Are the carts all heading in the same direction or would they split up? They all converge into one path. They head through the relatively thin woods that surround the northeastern side of Alfield. As you progress on that path out to the other side of the woods, continue into the northeastern fields where the rolling hills begin, these hills seem to go on for miles. Frumpkin would be in the air 300-400 feet in front of the cart and I wouldn't do 100% of the time, but I would talk for three minutes and then maybe hold on one sec (magic sound effect) and then come back. So intermittent.",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Perception,"to here, or-- Yeah, it's about up to your chest at times. Waist to chest. It varies. If I stand up in the cart as we go, can I see out into the grass? Yeah, if you wanted. What if I gave Jester a ride on my shoulders? While we walked. On a moving cart? What could possibly go wrong? You've seen Teen Wolf, ja? In the cart, and I'm holding you. It'd be kind of cool! I'll allow it. Go ahead and make a","perception check, Jester."
Perception,"barely holding you, the elbows start to buckle a bit, but rallies and (groans) holds you up above. You flatten your back out and give a graceful pose as you look ahead. I'm flying! I'm flying, Jack! (strained) Yeah, you are! King of the world! As you guys are coming up over a hill, you get a good view down, and you can see between the tall grass and the high weeds that are beginning to cluster this vicinity, there is a series of large hills that all break down into this valley where the grass just ends in this area. It looks like it's barren rock and dirt. You notice, with","that perception check, a few carts, a few broken"
Perception,"see? They appear to be empty. They're empty! Abandoned? Maybe. I'm going to start drinking. Jester, I'm going to put you down. Okay. How much do you drink? I'm going to take three big swigs. Okay, good to know. I would like to use Frumpkin to do a once-around from above to see if any of those beasts are on the horizon anywhere for us to kill, and also if there are any survivors or anything here.",MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin.
Survival,"whistle or something? To communicate with each other? I'm open to it, if you have any. Oh, what was that thing you did in the circus? That was cool. (whistling) (spitting noise) I can't do that. (various whistling noises) How about we don't make any noise at all, but we just sneak in? Yeah, let's do that. Having placed the cart where what you assume is the best you can hide it, who is helming the hiding of the cart? Me!",MATT: Go ahead and make a survival check.
Stealth,"I don't want to be on an end. I don't want you to be on the end. I don't mind being on an end. How about that? Yeah, I imagine that the ends are going to be where you need the most strength, right? I would grab Nott by the shoulder and pull us into the middle somehow. You want to be in the middle? Yes. Let's walk with Molly. There. Boom. Got it. Great. All right. We have: Molly, Nott, Caleb, Jester, Beau, then Fjord. Okay. I would like you","all to make a stealth check, please. As you make"
Perception,"okay? Hands are sweaty? Just was faster than I thought. Hey, look! We can use this hyena meat as bait! You're right. I'm going to go pull my bolt out of the thing. Is it recoverable? Good shot. Yeah, thankfully it was a clean enough shot, didn't seem to get caught or shatter against any of the bones. Quick perimeter check to see if we alerted anything, anything's looking at us.",MATT: Perception check.

I'll take the opposite side that he's doing. I'm going to look in the carts. Okay. You look in the carts, and they are empty. You see a few wayward pieces of cloth, everything in there is bloodied and caked, and has streaks of it being licked up.

I just want to get a quick peek, if we can. Well, I mean, I can send him in there, he'll probably hit the wall a few times, but if there's any fire or anything-- You wouldn't mind? No, you know, I can always bring him back, but be careful, all right? But there he goes. Yeah, there's no light in there. About 25","feet in, go ahead and make a perception check."
Perception,"Yeah, you won't be able to see anything through it. 21. 21. What faint light is coming in from the interior-- are you looking through? Yeah, I am. Yeah. As soon as you come inside, about 40 feet in, the shaft widens into a common area. You see a handful of tables, some chairs, similar to what was placed within the barricade, some sacks strewn about, some torn open and scattered across the ground, some that are still lobbed in the corner. Is that from a light source inside, or from sunlight coming in?",MATT: This is just a very high perception roll
Perception,"inside. Oh shit. I'm okay, it was just wood. What's going on? I've heard a confusing thing. Something fell down, but okay, we're good. I think we might have lost the element of surprise. Is it a bigger space in here? It is, actually. It opens up to be about 35 feet across from side to side, about 45 or 50 towards the end and then it seems to descend into two different pathways. Any signs of life? Anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Any signs of life? Anything? Make a perception check. Eight. At the moment, no. But as you're glancing about, you can see that there are bags of supplies that are partially sundered and torn open. You can see tools, some that look pretty interesting, there's a crowbar on the ground across the way, there's other sacks that haven't been spoiled yet. You see some of the burlap is dry rotted and pulls right apart, and it looks like there might be some useful things in this chamber. Okay. Real quick, I'll just poke through one of the bags.",MATT: Make an investigation check with
Investigation,"They both have the wooden frame for support. Wooden shafts. Come on, you people. We need a corner, and a camera for the corner, and a long paper hat for you to put you in the corner. I didn't even react to it, he had to point it out. Looking around, it looks like this was a common area. This is the closest chamber to the exterior of the mine. It looks like there were a number of tables here, that a lot of them have been knocked over and broken. A lot of what would have filled this chamber has been pushed into the barricade you saw up front. You're helming the",investigation? Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Stealth,"Okay, she needs another shot. You want me to go ahead again? Yeah. Oh boy. Which one are we going down, though? There's two entrances, aren't there? There are two paths, yes.

And search for traps.","MATT: Okay, so make a stealth check first."

Yes.",MATT: Make an investigation check with
Stealth,"coming here or-- Yeah, I don't mind commiting to one of these tunnels, I just want to make sure nothing comes behind us or comes up from the other way. Yeah, that's a good suggestion. First, what are we doing? What did you find out down that way? It just keeps going and starts snaking, and there's no traps, though. Let's go down the right one. Why?

A faint source of light in the center flickers, a small stone altar holding a cluster of candles in the central level platform. It looks like about six gnoll-like figures have gathered around this stone-- We were stealthing, we were stealthing. I know. We're going to get to that in just a second. Okay.

Stealth,"similar thing, have them see something behind them, but you can do the same thing. Yours are already cast, right? Not right now, no. But it's like that (snaps), it's easy, this one. Okay. I could try to get one of them to fight with one of the other ones of them. Yeah, that's good. Do that. I'm going to sneak up, down the steps to that little crook in there. Right here?

Bad physics? What's that-- kerning? Curling. Finished the hyenas' round. Nott, you're up. Seeing the gnoll's expression, I know it well. It's one of fear and about to run away. (laughter)",MATT: Make an insight check.
Perception,"It's an action you said? It's an action to apply it, yeah. There was a lot of gnoll chatter in here, and a lot of exploding orbs and stuff, so I'm going to guess that we have alerted whatever is beyond that we are here. How do we wish to proceed? Well, they make a lot of noise. They may not have noticed. Can I, since I'm in that general vicinity, go 20 or so feet into this hole and listen and see if I hear anything? They don't send orbs of fire through the air, though. As you step forward a little bit, make a",perception check.
Investigation,"I bend down-- You hear a few other cackling chuckles that echo shortly thereafter. I turn around and come back to the rest There's something bigger. Jester, could you give me a heal a little bit? I took a little bit of a beating. Oh sure. Yeah, I'll cast Cure Wounds on him. I think there's something bigger at play here. Whatever is driving these gnolls I think is deeper in. Can I look around and see if I can find anything like any papers, anything from that humanoid that might be intelligible?","MATT: Make an investigation check, please."
Religion,"smaller pieces of fresher flesh that have been stretched over the edges of the altar, like on the corners. You can see a similar grin across the center. It's all blood splattered from the hearts that were placed on there. As you wipe a little bit of it away, you can see stained into this loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the jagged smile. The jagged teeth that form a grin that the various tanned banners that are stapled into the stone walls show and reveal. But no notes. No books, no parchment. Can I try and figure out what this is, if I recognize this symbol in any way? I'd also like to join in on that with a",religion check.

Insight,"Well he seemed to be stabilized. I think the best thing we could do is to get him to safety. I agree. What were you doing down here? We ourselves were comin' down trying to rescue folks. I tend to look over the people who happen to be around here. I come by every once in a while. I used to live and grew up in this place, or in the valley not too far from here. Probably just like you, I heard a commotion. I've taken a few of these people to safety. I've been trying to do it less overtly than some of you. We do make a bit of a clatter. We're working on it.",SAM: Insight check!
Investigation,"cavern, I guess you'd say. Shaft. Yes, the shaft. That's a good way of putting it. That boom you may have heard happened to come from me, so we've got a little bit less to have to deal with. This, I really don't know what's going on. Oh, speaking of, I stand up and I walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from. Wait, Nott, do you want to let her take a look at it? In case it could blow up on you. I've seen their traps. I know their methods! Are there any ropes across the door? Let me look! Are there?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"How many dead bodies do you think I could carry? You could drag two. I'll take a couple as well. Because you're pretty strong, you could drag two bodies. I'm going to try to drag some of the dead out-- Everybody else can take one each, I think, based on your strengths. You can take none. Yeah, my dragging days are over. We're going to look around, see if there's anything of interest. All right, so two of you can make",investigation checks on this one.
Investigation,"You can't smell it. No, it smells good to me! Could be good bait later. That's why I'm taking it. Any baubles or little doodads? Nothing in this chamber, unfortunately. This one has either been picked clean or didn't contain anything of immediate worth in the process. Oh, I don't care about worth. I mean, there are plenty of bodies you could rummage through if you wanted to, but. As we're walking them, Nott's going through the pockets. Anything explosive?","MATT: You can make an investigation check, if"

That's four, five, six, seven. I will go ahead of the party to run point.",MATT: Make a perception check for me.
Perception,"this. I would say that I did not partake in any of that. As soon as we exited efficiently, I pulled out the silver thread and I'm already doing my thing while they do that. I would say, to the people inside: Stay safe, stay here. I look at everyone else and say: this isn't over. Let's go. Let's go. That's a badass motherfucker, I'm just saying. Yeah. I'm so about it. He's so cool. I know. Number one fan club.",LIAM: I guess we do not need a perception check.
Stealth,"Let's go. Let's go. That's a badass motherfucker, I'm just saying. Yeah. I'm so about it. He's so cool. I know. Number one fan club. I guess we do not need a perception check. All the bodies are placed in a small pile and a large heavy piece of canvas material is placed over them to hide them. The shed is closed and locked, and they all seem to feel, at least for the moment, comfort and safety in this space, as you all begin to delve once more into the mines beneath the hills. I would like you all to make a","stealth check, please, as you progress further in."
Perception,"tomorrow. Thanks for that. (laughter) He and I, we are like that. It's going on, it's going. He's very charming. I feel like we're seeing more of Caleb's social awkwardness, seeing him from the outside, it's so good. It's everything I could've wanted. As you take a moment to continue focusing, as you do, through the vision of your bird, (hovering hum) coasts down through the tunnel before you to keep an eye out.","Make a perception check for your bird, please."
Stealth,"I'm not interested in a relationship right now. Well, this isn't working at all. Offer her shiny things. Ah, you know what? You know the way this is turning out, I feel like you can get all kinds of gold and silver. Oh, yes! Pretty things. Sure, yes! Exactly. Yes, absolutely. Give me something. Oh well, it's waiting for you just down the hall. All you got to do is take care of a creature quietly and quickly. I feel inspired.","MATT: All right, so make your stealth check and"

On my bonus action, I'll cast Hex as well. That's five points of necrotic. Is my Guidance still helping at all? The Guidance only helps for the next six","seconds, so it helped him with the stealth check"
Perception,"As the gnoll pulling back its arrows, about to give out a large bellowing cry, makes a large inhale as it pulls back a second arrow and then both of you slam into it and watch as it falls to the ground, dropping its weapons that clatter against the stonework. It's not longer moving as you guys catch up. I go running past them right as they do it and cut its ears off. I'm opening up the jar. There you are. Thank you. Pull it back into the tunnel! Oh okay. I do that. Okay. You drag it back in, while you're down","you make perception checks, please."
Stealth,"As you rush down and grab the body, you glance up and whereas previously he described there was the singular gnoll and the two other skeletal ones in the opposite side, it appears that since it was given some indication of nearby sounds and it made that brief call before it began to approach, there are a few more gnolls that have appeared at the top of the platform above where the stairs crest. Do they see us? No, they do not at the moment, but only because they're not looking at your direction. As soon as you see it you immediately drag the body out of the way. I would like you both make a",stealth check to try to quietly drag the body
Stealth,Do you know how to do that? I could try. Let's try later. Why don't we do things we've done before? (laughter) What are you guys doing? Are we doing this? Let's fucking go. We're going to go in or-- this doesn't seem very smart! I don't know. I rub her head and give her a little blessing. Don't you worry. You keep hiding whenever you need it. What is this blessing?,LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks.
Sleight of Hand,"the shot and watch as it hits right in the sternum and pulls back its spear and with its final thrust of momentum, falls to the ground into a pile and is now bleeding out of its mouth as it's unconscious and dying on the ground. I'm a really good fighter you guys! Bonus action, I will cast Mage Hand and pull back the cloak around Shakäste's cloak, to see what's in his back pocket. Can you cast it as a bonus action?

If I can see in the dark. I need night vision goggles! You do. There is also that reddish glove that was affixed to his right hand. Don't touch it! I wonder if that makes spells better. (gasps) I'll run up onto the nest and start looking for stuff.","MATT: Make an investigation check for me, please."
Arcana,"Was it for the manticore? It looks like it would have been the size for a manticore. Since you rolled so high in investigation, you also notice that these manacles, which are open, have a single rune pressed into where they meet and lock in place, as there is no other visible locking mechanism. You are unable to really, at the moment, ascertain the nature of it. These manacles are fresh, they're clean compared to all the other stuff in here. They are there.

They're sitting in the back of the cart as it rides by with a single coachman whose single horse is pulling it along with a rather rapid pace. You watch as they begin to approach, the few bumps that hit the road are hitting them relatively hard because of the pace of which they're keeping. Some of them kind of get flung up, and you watch their hair get mussed and they quickly put it back into place. What kind of cargo does it look like they have?",MATT: Make a perception check.

History,"Nothing. Six. You're unable to make out any details of the construction of it or any significance of it, but it's an old helmet. And it looks like a lot of the edges of it appear to have just slowly been taken by the oxidization-- I'm going to take it back anyway. As you guys are waiting, Caleb's returned, and a few minutes later, maybe about ten minutes after, you watch as Molly approaches, tossing this deeply rusted iron helmet in his hand. What is that?

There isn't an elaborate system of maintaining Crownsguard members or identifying that you've noticed at least. Can I search for puncture marks? Stab wounds? Bite marks?",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Medicine,"Sure, easy enough to do. What about their weapons? Do they have any? They do. They both are carrying a longsword. They're well kept, not used. You look along the blade and there are barely any signs of indentation. Does it say anywhere ""Property of the Crownsguard?"" No, but they are uniform design. They're not elaborate or ornamental. The Crownsguard weaponry are all pretty much designed or provided by a similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel like they're uniform to a certain degree.",TRAVIS: Ten on the medicine check.
Perception,"Ten on the medicine check. That's enough. It's not too hard to see. As you look over each of the two bodies, both of them have heavy puncture marks, either right in the back of the neck on one of them, or the other one has it right under the front of the chin. The puncture marks are about that wide, about two inches across on each side where the skin and flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side and they go very deep in. So big fangs. Probably fucking pincers. You know (clicking). Yeah. So watch your shit. Caleb stands still for a second and looks around. Do I hear anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"some sort of webbing layer around it and all the walls are covered in it. Across the way you can see rungs and the end of this portion of the drainage that leads up into where you can see the wind would be coming through, and that faint bit of wind that's pushing through that's causing all the webs to shift is coming from what you can barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset light peeking through another exit. A sewage exit just like the one that you came in. You also see a number of other figures that are all webbed to the walls and encased within there. All of the ones webbed to the walls are just as emaciated and dead?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Okay. You stay there with the halfling. I might be able to negotiate my way a little further. Is Jester right up with the halfling? No, I'm 20 feet away from it. If you had to ballpark the distance to the halfling or to the very end of it? From you guys all together, it's about 25 feet, 30 feet. Jester is a little bit closer. All clear in the back! I'd forgotten. I am going to join Nott at the back and keep an eye on the rear. No need!",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"You see nothing in the darkness behind you. Who else is doing what? I am going to walk up to Jester and stand next to her and then I am going to send Schmidt forward to this halfling to try to maybe lift up his, its, I can't tell you. The chin of this halfling. I'm going to also move forward next to Caleb. You move forward next to Caleb as well. You guys are finding your feet sticking to the material of the floor webbing. You approach. You watch as the head of this halfling is pulled away from some of the webbing and lifted up. It is male. Actually, because you're still with Yasha in","the back, make a perception check both of you."

I meant to fix it in the break. Laura Bailey, the kind of friend that tells you when you have a booger in your nose. I really appreciate it. Can I jump this gap where Molly is and avoid the webbing? You can certainly try. Go ahead and make an","athletics check. You are standing in webbing, so"

A bolt sinks into its throat, and it starts shrieking, backing up defensively, the pain causing it to pull away from you. That's a serious amount of damage. Yeah. I scramble away in Caleb's direction, and that cocoon guy there. I'm going to hide right behind him.",MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.
Insight,"You're safe now! ""Oh god! (panicked breathing)."" He starts looking around, looking up at the faint bit of light now, which it's now just passing sunset. You see a little bit of purple light coming through, and through the little bits of webbing, you can see the grate that leads outside. He goes, ""I don't know how I got here."" You don't know how you got down here? You didn't come to the sewer on your own? ""Well I-- Yeah, I guess."" What were you doing down here?

You can trust us. We're one of you.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"Anything else interesting in the room, outside of the bodies? Outside of the bodies? It looks like there is broken bits of what would have been furniture or a cart at some time that got discarded or shoved down here from above. Other than that, just the general refuse you've come across down here in the sewer. We do have a spider body to pick. Can I happen to see-- am I able to see the guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff? Yeah, you see him. Oh, cool. Do I recognize any of the names of ships, or any imagery?",MATT: Make an investigation check on that.
Investigation,"(laughter) (sings) Continuity. Roll for continuity. Beau turns to Nott. Hey girl. Yeah. That little code you were talking. (clicks tongue) See any of that written around these walls, or something that looks similar to it? I can look around. Thieves' Cant is a written or spoken thing? Both.

Stealth,"I was under the assumption that you had to be de Rolo level to have a bath in your house. In your house. They have one washroom for the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has, and the water is changed every few hours, maybe. That's what I'm saying. But it's functional. That's why we should have gone to Pumat Sol's. That's why people have bathhouses, to clean up. When Fjord's taking a bath, I'm going to go through his stuff and try to find his letter. His letter?

I could overhear you offering an incentive for being a return customer. I did enjoy, most recently, unfortunately, one of your healing potions. Perhaps if I purchased a healing potion and the transfer of the enchantments, we could find some sort of a deal?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"Yes, please clean it. Please. ""All right."" It's not that bad. You don't have to act like it-- It was starting to-- it has a brine.

It's broken up into several pieces, but you can see a lot of the treetops, and there is this very natural, almost picturesque beauty of the interior. What was that called again? The Gilded Willows. It's the broken up residential aspects of this area. Okay, it's Bel-Air. Yeah. There is the Triumph Chime, which is a seven-story temple and belfry that has been retrofitted as the previous-- and you would know this from learning your history lessons--","actually, make a history check."
Persuasion,"Sex and history. She leans in for a moment and gives you a look. ""Follow me."" She leads you both to the back. She plucks a copy of Tusk Love. There's a guy in an Abraham Lincoln costume, just whacking it. (laughter) I'm following, by the way. Four score-- ""Define 'historical.' What are your interests?"" I like historical fiction. I don't like shallow smut. I like to learn something while I'm being titillated, I suppose.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"I walk up to one of the other patrons that's hurriedly looking through one of the books. Okay. The one that's closest to you, or one of the other ones? Sure. Whatever one is closest to me. The one that's closest to you, as you approach from behind, he has a dark brown cloak that's pulled over one shoulder. He's wearing a sky blue tunic, soft, a silk sheen to it in what little bit of lantern light is lighting the interior. From the side of his chin, you can see he's got a softer, rounder face, and as soon as you begin to approach, as you aren't approaching quietly, he stops, the book closes, back on the",shelf. Make a perception check.
Deception,"enough information to make out the full story, but it's this, ""How can I get this at a cheaper price?"" She's very heavy-handed with her innuendos. The salesman's like, ""Well, I don't know. How much are you willing to pay?"" It goes back and forth, and you're like, I see where this is going, but it's not going there fast enough. They keep talking about the heft of his equipment. A lot of reference to his equipment. The gauge of his pipe? Yeah, it's-- Do you--? ""Do you like it?"" Oh, do I.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Sleight of Hand,"Get people interested. ""It's kind of a word of mouth thing. The clientele prefer a bit of privacy."" Sure! While this was going on, and she was distracted. Oh no. Can I find one of the books that looks easily accessible? I want to open it up and on the ""We're watching you. We saw you come in here."" You grab a quick copy of Guard of My Heart.

Sleight of Hand,"quite the heavy drizzle it was earlier. It's lighting up a little bit. As soon as you step outside, you can see, way far off in the distance, a little bit of blue begin to break. The heavy part of the stormfront, at least, is beginning to pass. You pick up the remainder of your ordered baked goods and a loaf of bread as well. On the top shelf, behind you there. What do you call those? These pastries? I slide the smut under a tray of bread. You slide it under a what? A tray of bread on the counter. Just on the counter? Yeah. Hide it.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
Perception,"Open the curtains up! Did we get a good view? You get a decent view. It's not terribly high up, but you get to look down over the street below you, the cobblestones still slick and the rain pattering on the stonework. You see the fences that curl around the exterior of the terrace. The treetops are now more visible and the canopy is puffing up behind the larger estates and buildings that make up the interior of the Tri-Spires. You have a pretty decent view of the Zauber Spire from here. You see it domes towards the very peak. There is a glass, cylindrical, top floor that overlooks the entirety of the city.",Make a perception check.
Insight,"No. Actually, it's pretty well-cleaned and maintained underneath there. It's pretty well-cleaned though, so nothing is here that's good. Not even any bugs or anything. I don't know, look at this. Look at how much money is up here compared to elsewhere. This is a lot of control. Yeah. What are you going to do about it? (laughs) (sighs) Are you going to do something, Beau? I stick my head out. Are you planning a rebellion? No. I just want to make a ton of money and drink a lot of booze. Okay!",LIAM: Insight check.
Investigation,"A Tale of Two Titties. No. Courting of the Crick. Courting of the Crick. Good luck adding that shit. I know. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to type that in. I'll write that down. You've bought baked goods, you've bought smut, and you've played in a hotel room. What do you guys want to do now? I guess we can go back then. There's a casino. You want to go to the casino? I don't want to go there. Are there any religious temples here? You'd have to ask around. Make an",investigation check.
Investigation,"Yeah, in case it's a trap or something. Yeah, that dwarf didn't really give me a very good feeling. Also, we know that people are looking for these type of rebels. If we can see a board ratting people out, so can other people. We don't want to get caught in a sting operation, for lack of a better term. Right. You want to walk around the back to see if there's another way in? Yeah. Can we go around the back of the tavern and look for back doors, floor latches? Sure. Do you guys want to make separate",investigation checks or does one of you want to
Perception,"You get led outside in the soft drizzled exterior into the alleyway, feet clomping through the muddy floor. They show you to the outside of an angled door that leads to a basement cellar that is currently chained with a lock in the center of it. Can you pick this? Can I pick that lock? Yeah. Keep a lookout. I do a quick look. Both ends of the alleys and on the windows around the area. Yeah. He takes one end  I take the other.",MATT: Perception check from each of you guys and
Investigation,"Sure. Pull the lock of the chains, open the cellar and look down. It's dark. There's no light source in there. I have my orc-- I put on the goggles. Go for it, yeah. Might as well use that. You head down. It is a second cellar. It is not the same cellar you guys have met with before. It's not the same cellar. No, this one can only be reached from the exterior. There's no entrances? No secret entrances? No trap doors hiding behind barrels?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Medicine,"So you get a torch situated. It lights up, the room's brighter. No one knows we're down here, right? The door's closed. Well, I'm going to leave because we're all three down here and go back up to the top and keep an eye. Okay. Okay. Do we see anything else weird? More dead bodies, anything like that? No more dead bodies. Even this one you find is mostly like it was stuffed behind some of the barrels. Can I tell how it died?",MATT: You can make a medicine check.
History,"because what would the parents think? Yeah. What's the name of the half-orc? Uh-- (laughing) Oskar. With a K. Oskar. What you reading there, Jester? Nothing, Oskar. Don't worry about it. (laughter) Oh man. Beau, as you're reading through the book, it's interesting. It begins to talk about the conflict between the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian Empire. Conflict between the Julous Dominion? Yes, the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian",Empire. You're uncertain-- Make a history check?
Perception,"against the wall, then eventually disappears down into the cellar as well. Later on, you watch as Dolan, the human you had spoke with, that seemed to be the one spearheading this meeting before, enters with another human male. They both look back and forth, acknowledge you guys. The two of them eventually splinter off to different sides of the room, waiting. One, and a few minutes later, the other down into the cellar area. Did we recognize the other human male that he's with? No. Does he seem to be armed, or shady, or have lots of scars on his person?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"he's with? No. Does he seem to be armed, or shady, or have lots of scars on his person? Make a perception check. 13. 13. Hard to tell at this distance. You didn't see any visible or apparent scars or anything that gave you a sense of shiftiness, other than the careful demeanor. It didn't look to be a face of a rugged soldier, by any means. Did it look like an undercover cop, trying to blend in? How were his shoes?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Insight,"that guy's last name? Dolan's last name? Yeah. Sure. Any reason why? I know a guy named Dolan Taverski. Taverski? I don't really know, Taverski. I don't know. I've heard it. Just find out his last name! Sure. Is this guy from where you're from or something? Old mate of yours? No, just have something of his. Taverski. Would he know you if I was like, ""Hey, friend of ours named Nott--"" No, nope, would not know me.","TALIESIN: Insight check, watching this?"
Perception,"Powerful tricks. That's all. ""I appreciate that. And you, I guess as we begin to put this together, what are your specialties?"" I dabble a bit in the arcane, nothing too impressive, but a little more than nothing. ""Good. Very well then, tomorrow afternoon, The Song & Supper."" Would you like to exit first or should we? Ulog leans forward a bit and goes, ""After you."" Much obliged. I head out. I'll go along with Fjord.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"about this-- Lean in closer. Closer. This High-Richter Prucine. Have the ones downstairs already left? I don't know. At this point, you see Ulog make his way up and take a different table at the far corner. Then slowly, over the next 15 or so minutes, the other three exit the building. Want me to follow them? Should we go now? I'm going! Wait, blessings! Oh, thank you! I send Frumpkin after her.","MATT: Make a stealth check, please."
Perception,"Do I know any of their names? There's two human men and then there is the dwarf male. We would have told you the two humans. Two humans. The two humans. Are they traveling together? They are. You follow them for the next 20 or so minutes before they come to a modest home. It's in a little bit of disrepair especially in the recent the recent storm  part of the roof is sinking inward a little bit. They enter, close and lock the door behind them. They glance through the window and they have a heated conversation back and forth. If you want to listen, then make a",perception check.
Perception,"This is a man? They're both men. The other one has his arm around the other and consoles him. Looking inside, you see it's a lot of books across the wall, you recognize there are some alchemical vials or other things that similar-type glass containers that can be utilized for that. Some dried roots are hanging from the wall. A lot of them appear to be medicinal in nature. After about 20 minutes or so of watching this, nothing strange catches your eye. It seems like two people winding down after a stressful day. Are any of those books of an arcane nature, because I'm also looking?",MATT: Make a perception roll for Frumpkin.
Investigation,"doing? I feel the urge to go sneak into a room. It's just an open door with a bunch of buttons and a flask in it. It's not even locked? No. Oh, well, I'll push it open and look inside. What do I see? It's empty, it's dark, except for you see this-- Actually, make a-- Let me check one thing on this. Just to see how this works in this circumstance. Lot of great shirts in the store. Great shirts.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Insight,"No. We are going to have a talk. Don't try any funny business. Why are you trying to sneak through our stuff? I would never do that to a friend! Molly told me! Molly told me you were in here rifling through my stuff. I was hungry. There's a definite explanation for this. What were you looking for? Seafood. You must have some on you  you're of the sea. I love shrimp, and I never get a chance to get any, we're so landlocked in here. I love the taste of the sea! Do I believe her?",MATT: You can go ahead and make an insight check.
Acrobatics,"Remember, Nott, that next time you try and do this and if that letter goes missing again, I can do this to you again. I give her just enough of a knock on the head to break the spell. Okay. Okay, easy! Easy! Open up the door! I open the door and I slowly open it up like trying to funnel a rat out of the room. Here you go. Remember what we talked about. I reach for the flask. Fuck!

Stealth,"like they were last time. They haven't noticed your approach yet, but they are keeping an eye. We're going to have to distract them. I could have one of them beat the shit out of the other one. Oh! Why? Let's do that. I cast Crown of Madness on one of the guards. That's not going to go poorly. Yes! So into this! Okay! Hopefully from an area where they don't see me casting it.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Stealth,"because there's things down here. Oh yeah, avoid all the rat balloons! They were everywhere the last time.

I don't know what's--"" and you hear he's being held to the ground now, and people are shouting and, oh man. Ooh, that guy is definitely arrested. That guy's going to have a bad day!

Deception,"Let's go. I walk up to one of the two crownsguard outside the door. I follow behind him. Super official. Be careful, twinnie. There is actually only one crownsguard at the front door, behind the gate.

Please, if you wouldn't mind, would you fetch her?""",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"side, almost to a point. She has a gaunt, angular appearance, and is in the process of putting on ceremonial gold and white armor, similar to what you had seen on the Herald of the Hall, but a more elaborate design, and taken from the process of buckling together a brace. She walks up and goes, ""All right, now who's here for their time with me?"" Oh, High-Richter, it's so lovely to see you again. I know it's been quite a while. ""I have no idea who you are."" Brantley. We met-- must have been years ago now. You remember the Gala. I think it was a fundraiser, last time you were up for election?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"table they have ready for you guys to come and sit. We have already dropped our disguises if they recognized us. It took us 45 minutes to walk here. Your spells would have run out by now. Before we walk into the place, I turn my coat inside out, back to the blue. Any guards in the tavern? Not in the tavern, no. There was one outside, but patrolling the streets. Not everything is super heavily guarded in smaller areas like this. Does it look like anybody is looking at us, anybody else in the tavern?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"question of, well, the unsavory topic of payment. ""Right. I assumed that was probably going to be a thing. Me and Horris pitched in together. We don't have much, but this is too important to not. Me and Horris put together about 115 gold between the two of us."" He puts a small thing on the table, showing it. He's not putting it out in the open because he doesn't want to be like ""I have all this money on the table!"" He's like, ""We have some. Kara put in 53 gold of her own.""

Insight check on that statement.",MATT: Make an insight check.
Perception,"as he smiles. Do you have a good way to get into the Tri-Spire? ""We have a few ideas."" Okay. ""Til tomorrow, then!"" Til tomorrow. He gets up and finishes his drink and buttons the top button of his shirt, and then makes his way out. Ulog sits up, goes and takes what swills at the bottom of Dolan's drink and finishes it, then finishes his drink, pops it down. ""Til tomorrow."" He gets up and leaves. Has anyone been watching us?",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"We got to go back to the Tri-Spire? Which we can do. Or, no, we can just go to the hall of the Hall of Justice. (laughter) Meanwhile, at the Soltryce Academy. The King's Hall? Is that where Lord Sutan is? You don't know much about Lord Sutan. You haven't heard his name referenced at all with any of the-- They just left and we forgot to ask where the fuck he is! Twice! Can we run out after them? Wait wait wait!",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"the gate and the building itself. Are the gates chained shut or does it look like there's a lever? Well the gates on all them are solid except for in the very front and the very back. Both of them appear to be closed and locked. You do see, posted at the front of the front door, there are two crownsguard that are there keeping watch. On the back end as you case around to the rear side of the home, there is a singular crownsguard and a dog that is on a chain. Two in front. Does it look like there's any blind spots, any trees that go up and cusp over the walls?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Just some simple reconnaissance. See if we can see Ren, maybe have a conversation with him. If he's not a total prick, I don't know, maybe he's got some of his dad's handwriting. Yeah, okay. We don't have to go, I don't care. No it's fine. It sounds scary to me. No I-- my head is not in the game. We'll go along. Great, we're going to head towards the Apple Tree Tuneship? What did I write here? (laughs) The Tutoring Village. Thank you.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Persuasion,"across the entirety of the roof complex. You can see one small trap door, about the center of it, that is currently closed. Okay, I call him back. (Meowing) Then I (snaps fingers). And then he's on my shoulder. At which point, you hear a kid go, ""Whoa!"" Simon is now on the side, staring at this disappearing and reappearing cat. Yeah, cats are the best. I don't know, there's a trap door up there, but, I mean, we're not going in. Go. Go away! Go. Go away! Shoo! Go away!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Deception,"(coughing) No, you need help. It's real gross. I'm fine! He reaches down and pulls a cloth up and puts it immediately over his face. ""Okay, um-- "" No, I don't -- I was born in a place like this. I don't want anything to -- I'm going to give myself a little (grunt). Sir, there's -- (vomit). I'm going to go for it right in his face. The ruckus is audible all the way down the block, so I turn myself into a half-orc woman and pick up Nott like my baby and put her head on my shoulder and start walking towards the building. Okay. As you're doing that, I need you to",roll a deception check with advantage because
Deception,"the center of the building with the two hallways that bisect the two areas. You can choose right or left, it's up to you. The clerk went down the right side. I will take the left one if the clerk went down the right side. Okay. As you're rushing with Nott in your arms, you head into the hallway on the left side and you glance and can immediately see another person with a robe, who is holding a small satchel of some sort of greenish material. They walk and see you. ""Excuse me, can I help you?"" (crying) (baby wails)","MATT: Make a deception check, please."
Athletics,"rooms on the side. They open one room and there's somebody in there already who was sleeping but is starting to come to, going, ""What's happening?"" ""Sorry!"" They close the door, go to the next chamber, and start dragging you into an empty room. I'm going to immediately -- I'm going to go limp. Okay. Then the minute the door's open, I'm going to make a break for it. All right. They open the door-- I'm out! You bolt? I'm going to bolt. Full speed.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Stealth,"Yeah, never mind. It's fine. They shove you into the chamber. They close the door. You land on the ground and you hear it lock behind you. All right. You are now a dangerous patient who needs other glancing. While that's happening and they're distracted by that, you guys-- Look for an empty room. Or is every room in the house full? I'd say about half of them are full. You see two chambers that are empty. I go in and shut the door behind us. All right. You close the door. You guys both",make stealth checks real fast.
Deception,"No. Well don't give up! (cough) I walk out towards them. Do you have a privy? I think I shat myself. There are two clerks now that were originally fleeing to get help and have come back now with the gentleman with the short brown hair, who's exited the opposite side of the chamber now. ""We've brought the doctor."" He moves before the doctor, who approaches. ""All right, so you appear to be sick."" Yeah. (cough) I have a terrible cough and apparently my breakfast didn't agree with me and I coughed a little too much and felt a pack in my pants.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Intimidation,"You don't have anything in the building? ""Get in the room. We'll get you a pan."" All right. Yeah. I go in the room. You go in the room, and one of them pulls out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side. Can I have a little privacy while I check my undercarriage? They close the door immediately and then “We’ll get to him in a second. What’s your problem?” (soft voice) Fever. She has a fever. “Let me see her.” He comes forward and puts his hands out towards Nott. (hisses)",MATT: Do you do that? Make an intimidation check
Acrobatics,"What’s your problem?” (soft voice) Fever. She has a fever. “Let me see her.” He comes forward and puts his hands out towards Nott. (hisses) Do you do that? Make an intimidation check with advantage. Intimidation? Negative three?! How is that possible? 13. 13. The physician goes (screams), falls back. The other two clerks or physician helpers “Get it out! Get it out! Out! Shoo!” I’m going to scamper towards the office if I can, as fast as I can.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and dodge
Stealth,"the facility. Nott got tossed, landed, and stumbled a few feet, and they’re now shouting for the guard and pointing at Nott. Pointing at us? Okay. Enemy of My Enemy now? (groans) That still seems extreme. We should just book it. Are you fast? All right, fine. I’m not leaving you. I’m much faster than you. You guys start bolting? We’re going to start to run. As you guys run, they don’t give chase because it’s not their job to do so, but they start shouting and shouting. I want you both to",roll stealth checks to try and see if you can
Investigation,"about, “I don’t know what happened. He went crazy and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere,” and they’re both making their way to the door where Molly is in. That was very unruly  I need to excuse myself for a moment. I’ll head out of the infirmary. Okay. You head back out onto the street. You are in that chamber for a while. Are you doing anything? How long has it been? I’m heading out of the infirmary and I’m going to start wrapping around the building towards the side of the building that he was in. I’m seeing how-- is it possible to open the window?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Deception,"All right! You shoulder-roll-leap through, shattering the window out of the infirmary, rolling into the alley. You see this happen as Molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and purple skin. Run! You guys bolt. At this point, as you head back, you’ve now seen the guards that have just run off to go after Nott hear the shatter and turn around to begin, some of them, to double back to where the sound of the glass breaking came from. Can I point off in a different direction than Molly’s running, since I look like a hospital clerk nurse?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"(laughter) Feels like it matters. Did we get paid in advance, by the way? What are we being paid for this? Yeah, we didn't get paid in advance. I hope that doesn't come back to bite us. Did we get half of it, even? It's for the best, because now there's no paper trail, just in case they are trying to-- Is Ulog around? I'm going to look for Ulog. Ulog is meeting you guys, you want to try and search for him? I want to look and see if he's around us, though.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"Yes, but there are lanterns and stuff up on the side of the street. Do you want to distract him and we'll meet you on the other side? Oh, sure! I'll go meet you at the sewer entrance on the other side. Okay. Nott or Caleb can send you a message. Okay. I walk up to the guard. Okay. ""Evening."" Evening, how are you doing today? ""I am well, how are you?"" Pretty good. I was wondering if you could answer a question for me.","MATT: Everybody else, roll a stealth check,"
Persuasion,"Evening, how are you doing today? ""I am well, how are you?"" Pretty good. I was wondering if you could answer a question for me. Everybody else, roll a stealth check, please. I was looking around this area earlier for a candy shop and I couldn't find anything that seemed good. I was wondering if you could point me in the best direction. ""Try the Pentamarket, probably."" The Pentamarket, um, okay. Can you tell me exactly where that is? Because I'm not familiar with the area.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Deception,"Okay, natural one’s tricky. Plus eight. Still a natural one. But, yeah, that brings it to nine. As you guys begin to quickly slide in, one after the other, Nott, as you're rushing down, you're glancing off, because you hear them talk about candy for a second over the side. Ooh! As you rush down the side, whack! You hit your head and give out a natural instinct, a pained squeak. As you do, the guard who's talking to Jester goes, “Wha--” (fake coughs loudly) Can you help me? I think I’m choking.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"it! You guys are sitting there, waiting for Jester to show up and meet you to let you out. I cast Message a few times. We’re here. Where are you? Where letter-R letter-U? You, however, you make your way to the Song and Supper, and on the inside, you can see, nervously at a table, in a dark cloak, Ulog. “What the--?” Gets up and meets you outside, shoves you back out there and you both begin to walk side-by-side. “I was waiting here long enough!” We were waiting for you! It’s so weird that we totally missed you, though.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"like a kid who has outgrown his snow-outfit and he’s like-- “This is humiliating.” It’ll get you in the door, don’t worry. Here, put this mask on. He’s seething beneath it. You can see him grinding his teeth, but he follows you nevertheless. Candy-themed, too. Oh, that’s great! You make your way to the gate once more. The guards there-- One of them walks up and, the same one from earlier, gives you a nod. “Hold.” Guest of honor for the night. He’s a comedian.",MATT: Make another deception check.
Insight,"the breaking and entering thing. Plus, I want to be there when this happens. Have a personal stake."" Yeah, he should be a part of the team that goes in. Okay. How well do you know Lord Sutan’s place and the area? “I know the area alright.” All right. We cased it earlier. “Do you think you know where he lives?” Yes. “All right. That’s all we need. The rest we can all do. Lead on.”",LIAM: Can I insight check him? Just get a feel for
Perception,"arriving, some locally, some appear to be from other areas within the actual Empire. The social elite are gathering in the center of the Silken Terrace and you can now see the small carriages are stopping and letting other individuals out to join the crowds, the mingling beginning. You can already see about 60 or 70 people, with more still arriving. They all have their various colors and masks on. They’re all grabbing drinks and laughing and seeing old friends and introducing themselves to new people they haven’t met before.

May I also do the same thing? Ten.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"No, no good. Eight. Unfortunately, you’re too far away and the masks obscure any of sort of details. You’re unable to see anyone you recognize, per se. But you do see that there are long tables that mark the perimeter that are already holding already preset glasses of wine and ciders. You can see the central tower of the Triumph Chime sits glowing right at the front and center of this gala. It’s all surrounding the base of it. And up in a spiral you can see lanterns and similar colors of autumn that spiral up the front of it. You guys begin to, carefully, and out of sight, make your way towards the estate of Lord Sutan. Please make","stealth checks, everybody."
Athletics,"could hold the other end and help people. You can jump ten feet? I think I can. Oh, dear lord. What if you fall on the ground, Beau? Let this happen. Let this happen. Look, we're basically gods, okay? (laughter) I can make this jump. You going to try? I'm going to cast step of the wind-- Sorry, not cast it. I'm going to use a ki point. I'm going to take a breath, gather my chi. Along the edge of the branch anime run--",MATT: Okay. And leap. Make an athletics check.
Investigation,"There is a chimney stack, though, right? A chimney stack? We're not Santa Claus! We are now. (laughter) Is there a door on the roof? How would there be a stupid door on the roof? There could be. Sometimes there's balconies. There's no balconies. There's no balconies on this house. Look around for a door on the roof! What? Who would have a door on the roof? Rich people.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Hey, Nott. Send a message to Fjord and say, ""Hey, did we look cool, just then?"" Okay, I take out my little piece of wire and I whisper the incantation and do the motions. Did we look cool? You can respond to this message. (laughter) Did they go already? He said, ""Did they go already?"" (laughter) I heard a dog barking. I feel that this plan was no better than ours. You guys are watching  you guys are on--? We’re keeping an eye on the street.",MATT: Perception check from both you guys.
Investigation,"You do. It's a very small crawl space. It's maybe, like, ten foot by five foot. It's very dusty in here. It looks like there are a few clay pots. There looks to be a portrait, like some sort of a large art piece, that's leaning against the wall and has some cobwebs over it. Other than that, it looks fairly empty, like it hasn't been used fully. You, casting Detect Magic. Let me check real fast. Yeah. So you look around the vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace. Are there any other doors in this crawl space that lead into the main?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"So you guys have made your way down into the hallway. You’re still concentrating the spell, right? Hells yes. There are magical auras emulating from these torches. They're both everlight. You've seen this magic before. They just continuously burn. It’s continual flame. You also get a faint magical aura from each of the suits of armor, and a faint magical aura from the sword across the way on the opposite wall. Okay. Like traps? Or they are just-- I'm going to look for traps.",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check
Perception,"I'm over here. We're making progress! (laughter) As you guys head in, there's the closed door that leads into the chamber where you're sensing this aura. Okay. Detect for traps. Look for traps on this door. Me? Okay. I'm gonna look for traps. Eight, plus five. 13. 13, okay. It is trapped. Oh! It's a door? That's trapped? Yes. It's not locked, but it is trapped. Do I hear any movement in the house?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yes. It's not locked, but it is trapped. Do I hear any movement in the house? Make a perception check. How do we disarm a trap? Not bad, not bad. We let Ulog do it! 15. 15. You listen out. You do not hear any movement in the house other than what you currently are making. Okay. (hiccups) And a hiccup from out in the distance. Hello, pick a card.","MATT: Perception check from both of you guys, by"
Investigation,"of some kind. It is made of dark iron, and gives a very faint magical aura to it. The rug in the center of the room gives a faint magical aura as well. The rug? Flying carpet! No. Look for traps in the room. Okay. Did you see the lock I just-- Fuckin' focus! I did, but hurry! 19. You're looking for-- Traps.","MATT: Okay, investigation check. You glance around"
Investigation,"Can Schmidt stand on the carpet? Oh! I can move it with my Mage Hand or something, or peel it back with my mage hand. Mage Hand. Very helpful when setting grappling hooks on roofs. Oh, shit! Shut up, Ulog! ""I'm just saying, if I knew you could do that, you could've--"" Fuck you, I know what I'm doing. So move the fucking carpet! You want me to move the carpet? Move the rug. Can I do a look for anything that looks out of place, any papers, anything, trap doors?",MATT: Investigation check.
Athletics,"Whoa! From one healing potion? Greater. There you go. Top of the round. Nott, your turn. As you come to consciousness, you are still prone. Return that damage. Caleb moved around to join your side there to go ahead and apply the potion. We can't hurt Beau! No, it's fine. I will go and try to wrestle the-- You're a god!

Athletics,"You know what, go ahead and make an athletics check. Two. No. You rush up and you grab it, and it actually lifts you off your feet and you are now being flailed in the air as you're grabbing the edge of the rug, going (screams). (screaming) All right that ends your turn. Jester, you're up. I'm going to try to go help Nott and I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to try to pry the rug off of Beau. Okay. You move up. Go ahead and make an",athletics check.
Athletics,"No, she's not out. She's hanging on. The rug is barely holding on by a thread. You see it still keeps her constrained. You see parts of it are fraying and falling apart. The threads are dangling, but it's still keeping its mass strongly and tightly around her. It's still crushing her and mainly wrapped around her face so she can't see and she can't breathe. That ends the rug's turn. Caleb, you're up. Ja. You're up. What am I doing? I rush forward and I am going to try to pry the rug off of her.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
History,"collector's items, that are arranged on the bottom of it that all look like old museum pieces. Do they have any symbols on them? On the statues? All magical, I assume. I assume they're glowing. Are you still concentrating? Yeah, I haven't cast anything that breaks that. That's true, you didn't take any damage. None of them are glowing except for the cobalt bracers. Do I recognize any symbols or see any symbols on the statues?",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"No, that's different. Those are letters we were leaving here. Yeah, Thieves' Cant we're leaving here. Yeah. So we should leave them here. But we wrote up the letters for the High-Richter too, just so we can stamp. We didn't actually write that letter yet because I was waiting for his handwriting. Yeah we did because we put the Knights of Requital in it. The KR symbol. Sure, why not? From Richter to Sutan we did, so we're leaving those, and we're leaving a note--","MATT: Marisha, make a perception check. You both"

(clears throat) There's four of them that are approaching and they're going by and keeping an eye on things. I walk up to the four of them. Okay. I heard there's a disturbance over here. I need some assistance, please. ""What kind of disturbance?"" There's a rowdy bunch over here, been drinking too much already, anticipating the festival. Would you come with me?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Athletics,"""We're all right, but thank you."" They keep walking. I sent the cat, so the cat should be-- Yeah. (angry meow) Frumpkin makes his way around. (barking) Again, the dog unleashes a torrent of barks, like ""No, not again!"" You hear the other guy being pulled across the yard. He's being dragged through the wet grass.

Good god! There were those hooligans that were roughing us up earlier. Are you all right? They hurt me so bad. I knew you were going to be okay, anyway. Do you mind helping?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"than to go-- Could be. Okay. We'll book it to the other entrance. Okay, you rush around through the street. You make your way back to the northern gate to the district and there there is another nine or ten guards stationed, with one on the top of the wall with their crossbow ready. I'm pristine and sober. As you approach, ""Hey! Sorry, no entry. The gala is tonight."" I know. We're going to the gala. Obviously. Masked.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"like it had wine spilled on it. Like, covering up the rest of the outfit, a big-- A white cloak? A white cloak that looks like it had red wine spilled down the front. Fjord, you explain to the guards that I'm very pissed off because someone spilled their drink on me. Yep. All right. What are the rest of you guys doing? I'm going to go around and see if there's any other entrances, or if there's any other guards around the perimeter. I join Nott. We'll flank.","MATT: Make a perception check with advantage,"
Athletics,"a ten-foot yard, towards the very back area. There's a small porch area with nice chair and a little reading nook. There's a book left outside that looks like it got rained on and forgotten, it's dried and crinkled. There is a door that leads in from the back of that porch area there. Are there any people? There are no people in the back. You want me to give you a boost? Yeah. I relayed that all to them. There's nobody back there, right? Yeah. Seven feet tall. Easy. Nott, come on, ready? Me and Caleb. One, two, three. (squeals)","MATT: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics,"
Deception,"You almost land on the book table, causing it to knock over, but you just miss it. You're there quietly now, there's the door across the way. What are you guys doing? We're going in. We're disguised and we're walking straight up. You approach the two guards and they both look at each other. I look incredibly angry. I'm about ten feet in front of her, and I walk up.

Athletics,"(metal hitting the table) Sorry. There you go. To the left it, looks like a kitchen vicinity, and there's the spiral staircase that leads up. We should go up. There were a lot of traps in the last house we were in. Outside of the wall where you guys are, Ulog's like, ""My turn. Give me a lift?"" Fuck. God, are you sure, Ulog? You're going up?

Investigation,"off the other side, landing next to Nott. Oh, he leaps? I was going to say, seeing that argument, that I dropped down to the ground on the other side. And not help him. He glances up, sees you gone, and leaps. He barely crests the top. He's a nimble dwarf. He could cost us everything. Slightly ahead of the house, so I can see if people are going to be approaching the house, I put my jacket down and set up a little busking. A mild busk. Jester, I know we have to move, and it's not our thing, can we roughly check the stairwell for traps?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Yeah, sure. We start walking to look for her room. There's three sets of these. So you do one then the other. Each one. One, two, three, one two three. You do it together, all three of them shift, and with each one you hear a click and release. You guys are in the backyard. Are you doing anything? I'm going to try to open the back door.

He's just watching you as you walk. So you're going to try and move out of his eyesight? I'm going to try and move around, yeah, and move out of his eyesight. You move out of his eyesight. Anything?

They're all excited looking at it. It's definitely distracting the current group. The one guard there is like, ""Go, back! Back!"" to everybody.

Perception,"I'm going to have to find her again at some point. The reason I've stayed quiet-- It was never going to work. Somebody was working against me. I don't know who, but I can't trust anyone. I saw how you reacted to seeing me and it was-- I'm willing to believe it wasn't you who turned. But it could have been her, but it could have been one of us. That's why I need you to keep it quiet. Please. Make a deception check. You're starting to get in deep into this now. Deception check? 13. Can I wander over and see if I can overhear anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"the other night? Or are you rolling in it? Am I rolling in it? Yeah, I'm wondering if you just wagered the party's funds. On a very calculated risk. Oh. No, I was actually only gambling my funds. So you come with funds on you. Yeah. Do you know, I would be all right if you had? I am a fan of calculated risks. Are you? Yeah. But it was just, you know-- You're flush. I understand. At the moment.",LIAM: Insight check.

How long have you been here in the Empire? For about-- I don't know, when did I meet you? God, was it a year and a half ago? Year and a half. Give or take. How many people are listening in on this clearly right now?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"They are serving us free drinks, of course they're listening to everything we say. Let's retire for the evening. Don't we need to talk to Kara? We can come back and do this tomorrow. No! She's right here today! You talk to Kara, then, but no more whatever this is. Why, Lucien? You afraid the Myriad will hear? What's his reaction? He definitely had a thing! I am genuinely a little drunk, and didn't remember who the Myriad were. Do I believe him?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Insight,"to kiss later? That's a good one. Have to remember that one. ""Look, I deceived no one, outside of what you needed to know. We got our business done. I've ""done nothing wrong."" How much of this was orchestrated from the beginning? Were we a distraction for the bigger picture? ""What do you mean?"" The attack on the tower. ""Oh, the Crick attack on the tower? No, had nothing to do with us. We're not going to work ""with those savage beasts.""",MARISHA: Insight check.
Religion,"truth thinks you owe it something. None of that. I like my bullshit. It's good. It's happy. It makes other people happy. But it's not who you are. It is exactly who I am. Can I ask you, when you're praying over your swords at night, are you actually doing anything? Well, do you know who the Moonweaver is? No. Excellent. The swords are cheap carnival glass. There's nothing special about them. May I make a check to see if I have ever heard of the Moonweaver?",MATT: Make a religion check.
Insight,"Some people are vulnerable and looking for answers. I left every town better than I found it. Which tattoos are the old ones? I mean, I don't want to see your naked body or anything. But do you have some? Is it-- yeah, no. So I show off the peacock a little bit. One of the peacock feathers on the neck-- What about your tattoos, though? Thank you, Liam. One of the eyes on one of the peacock feathers is a bright crimson red, which any of you if you'd ever made a fucking","insight check would know. God, I was waiting for"

Stealth,"to discombobulate you, and direction in the chamber, and pull you through in different ways, to prevent you from orienting where you were and where you're going. Eventually you're led through a doorway, you hear some things shift, and then turned around a bit, and then led down a ladder. The ladder goes down for about 20 or so feet before your feet touch some sort of soft dirt, packed dirt-type feeling. The sound of the music and chatter vanishes up ahead and you hear, as soon as you all head down the ladder, a latch close and lock above you. How did my cat do? Your cat managed to-- actually, make a",stealth check.
Perception,(Pigeon cooing) --continue down the river for a short time. The river splits up for a bit and actually divides into two tunnels. Where are we going? Should one of us go in one and one of us go in the other? That seems not like a good idea. I know something about sailing! The right one is the bow and the left one is the stern. Should we go in the bow or the stern? Is there water running to the left or the right? Does it look like it picks up current on either side?,MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage

Does it look like it picks up current on either side? Make a perception check with disadvantage because of the low light. Oh, that's a fucking two. That's four. Yeah. Hard to tell at this distance and it's coming up quickly. Can we feel more wind coming from either side?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"ceiling has come in and above it is just dirt. It's loose rock and pieces of well-carved stone and masonry that have been destroyed, apparently upon exiting whatever was beyond this wall. Can I see what was giving me the arcane signature? You feel it on the opposite, the other side of this rock slide. Can we clear out these rocks? I think we just need to get closer. But we're right here. Yeah. What about you two beefcakes? Can you move these stones out of the way? (grunting)",MATT: Both of you make athletics checks to get

(deep voice) I always take up the rears. I'm always a fan of the rears. Yeah, I was going to say not the back, but I will let the bruiser walk behind me. So Beau's at the back keeping an eye open. As you guys slowly step down the stone stairs, deeper and deeper still-- Check for traps!",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Rogue shit! That's going to be a 26 to hit. That hits. You take five points of piercing damage as a long, metal bolt fires out of the hole and sticks you right in the front of the thigh. Ah! Fuck! (laughter) I found a trap! Really? Is it spent now? Let me check. I'll see if there's any other triggers for this trap. On this trap, at this floor point? You jump",up and down. Make an investigation check if you
Investigation,"Great. You hear a (clanking) on the inside of the wall there, and that trap is busted. Are there any more? I don't know! I check for more traps. Two for investigation. Two for investigation? Has the party held up at this point? You guys are all just in the back watching this happen. I don't know how to be a rogue! While that happened, I would like to investigate the part of the room that I can see. Is there anything dangerous or hinky?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Maybe nobody else do that. No, I'm going to run. I feel like this is going well. I'm running. All right. As you guys run through, it's still resetting. Who's going through? I'm going for it. Are we all going? Ah! I'm running! I'm holding onto Mollymauk and just following. Who's holding up the back? I'll hold up the back. I want to look around and see if I see anything that looks of value.","MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage,"
Perception,"the floor. How do we turn a ceiling? Maybe we've got to go all the way back up to the top. That's my thought. The top of what? The spiral staircase. To see from the top? We need a down here team and an up here team and maybe a Frumpkin to communicate through. Well, I will remember this. I have a perfect memory, I will remember this exactly. Does the pillar coming out of the ceiling have a hole in it as well?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"I am really good at finding holes. She talks about them a lot. Yeah. 20. Glancing up at it, the pillar itself comes down in a square-shape, and the very base of it has a slight curvature or dome to it, but it is solid. You don't see any seams in it, you don't see any marking. It is just a solid pillar. It's about ten feet wide or so. Has ten minutes gone by yet? At this point, yeah, as they began to look around. You said you're searching for anything else in the chamber. That looks like it would fit in the rod.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"are inset with art pieces once were set, but are gone. There are shelves in places in here, where things of worth were once set but have already been taken. The opposite side of the room, by the way, has completely fallen in. This chamber should be about 80 feet across, but it looks like something has happened and caused it to collapse inward, and the chamber is slightly tilted to one side. There's a slight tilt, a decline towards the left-hand side of the chamber. There are two load-bearing pillars that mark the center of the chamber that lead up to the ceiling, and the ceiling itself is about 30 feet up, similar height to the previous chamber you were in. Make a",perception check for Frumpkin.
Perception,"I'm walking in. So you all begin to make your way inside this chamber. Anything arcane before it dips out? Nothing arcane in nature that catches your attention immediately in a 30 foot distance. Are you heading into the chamber? No. I'm behind Beau. Okay. Behind Beau, at the entrance way, you don't feel any arcane presence. The rest of you begin to push past, and make your way into the chamber. And once again you see-- Any ghosty globbies? Yeah, I'll looking for will-o'-wisps.",MATT: That'd be perception checks from both you
Investigation,"I'm going to scoot up behind Fjord and see if I can detect any arcane anything before the spell sniffs out. Okay. In the final throes of the spell, the source of that metallic shine does give a faint, arcane, magical aura before the spell fades. What kind was it? For that one? It would be abjuration. Yeah. I'm going to scoot around the side and see if I can peek into those holes. Those reliefs in the walls. The alcoves? Alcoves. Okay. You head over to the side alcove. Make",an investigation check.
Perception,"quarter of an inch deep. Should I stick something in these eyes? Maybe. Is there any way to see what is in the urns? Like just have a peeksies. You come towards the urn. You have to pull it out slightly to look into it because the interior is too hard to see from this point. I'm going to get my crossbow ready to fire. Okay. Can I just, with my sword, just a little. Sure. You take your sword and wedge it out. It shifts forward a little bit and you look inside. It looks like there is ash in the urn.",It's only about halfway full. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"You hear your name and you look up just as the torch-- Okay! You reach up and try and grab it. Catch it, (fumbling). Let it fall! Falls in the clothes, I start burning alive. A rope? Yeah. We already have a rope down. I put a rope down. Can I look around, see if there are any weapons or objects?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"upstairs if you want to. You want to rest first or do you want me to tell you what it is now? You can tell me what it is now. Okay, so 10 minutes that takes. Identify. All right, that is a potion of necrotic resistance. Well, I don't have it. You have it. ""When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to necrotic damage for one hour."" Nice. Cool. Whenever we get done with the short rest, can Beau start peeking through and digging away at the collapsed entrance into that tunnel?",MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.
Investigation,"I'm going to join Molly, I think someone needs to be upstairs. You guys stay. Molly, you have the bowls right? I have the bowls. Beau and Molly head back up the stairs. I'm going to take a look at that purple-- is there only one of those little purple glowing rocks that seems to be creating light? As you look going through, you see there are a few other stone cages that have been opened and left empty. That is one that has not been removed. I'm going to open it and I will-- I'm going to poke at it to see if it seems trapped or anything.","MATT: Okay, make an investigation check."
Investigation,"bookcase. That's all you can see at this distance. The dome cages are solid steel, or are they bars? They're bars, but the bars are an inch, inch and a half between each. It's very little space in between. I'm going to start heading in this direction, too. Does one of them look like it was possibly holding a gelatinous cube at some point? Are you entering the chamber to look? Yeah, I'll go with you. You should detect traps. All right, I'll look for traps. I know it's my job.",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Perception,"pill-shaped side rooms, and across the way there is the bookcase and the two tables. As you get closer and see, there's two non-lit candelabra. What faint bits of candle remnants are there are mostly melted, and the wax dripping off and causing small pools in the ground, but they've been cold for some time. I go over to one of the cages. Did we wait the short amount of time for Detect Magic? I am in-between you and them, and I'm come on, come on. I go over to one of the cages, the nearest left one.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"14. You glance through with the light that's flickering through the various gaps in this iron cage, and inside you can see a similar clay urn, deep red, sitting in the center. You see burnt and tattered clothing at the sides of it. Oh jeez. Got another urn here full of ash. Be careful! Kill it! Break it! Anyone want to check the other cages? Make sure it's not the same thing in each? I'll go take a look at the other cage. I'll go look at another one.",MATT: You glance-- make a perception check.
Arcana,"the ash down within, there are remnants of ash around the outside in a circle, and bits of cloth and material, and this chain noose hanging above where this urn was. Would I be insane for thinking this is how they make them? Make what? The will-o'-wisps. The will-o'-wisps are the dead. They are left from the dead. This was a factory, maybe? Heading over to Molly, I stop in the middle of the room at that inert circle. Does it look like anything?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Investigation,"We can wait until later. Put it in the bag. It's very sharp and the bag is easily punctured and I don't want to risk it. I'll strap it to my back. Shouldn't we, for good measure, be breaking up these other ceramic--? Are those ceramic pots giving anything off? The tables, by the way, that are right next to the bookshelf, have writing utensils, quills on the side, one has an inkwell that has been long dried over that has a spider web attached to it. Does it have any paper?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"cloth of its body suddenly scatter, like someone had blown a heavy wind into a stack of loose cloth that all eventually turns into ash and vanishes. There, you see a dull blue glow where the sword is grinding against the stone, before that eventually dissipates into nothingness. Yeah, ghostslayer! Last pot! Good job, Molly. Beau, your stun wears off. That guy knew way too much about everything. Caleb. Can I see that last pot from where I am?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"That brings us to Jester's turn, as you come to consciousness, since you guys are on the same initiative. You can do something, if you like. Pot! Pot! I guess I'll walk over and try to take out the pot. That's half your movement to get up, and then five, ten, 15, that's as far as you get. Can I try to throw something at it? What do you have to throw? Yeah, I don't think I have anything that will fit through that little hole-- I could try picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at it.",MATT: You can make an investigation check to try
Religion,"Grab his heart and run. From the ground. There was no heart on the ground As you struck it, the energy dispersed. Let's run away. What if we have to get it with the sword? It's a two-handed weapon. I can't do it. Yasha can, though. Why? You're strong! You can do it. I can't use two-handed weapons. As you guys watch it push out of the wall, (gasping sound) making its way there. Wait! Maybe if we show it the sword, he'll chill out. Caleb, make an intelligence check. You make","a religion check with advantage, because you have undead."
Athletics,"Right, okay. That finishes its turn. Beau, you're up. You watch Yasha slam on the ground, unconscious next to you, the blade clattering to the ground and coming to rest. The creature lifts up (wheezing) and vanishes into the stone above you. I can't get a reaction from it, as it goes? It was not close enough to you, unfortunately. Fuck. I'm going to run over to this bookcase and put my staff behind it to see if I can knock it over. You get the staff on the fulcrum. Go ahead",and make an athletics check to force it.
Athletics,"Roll for that. 2d4 plus your Wisdom modifier. Six plus four. Ten! You heal ten hit points. Yasha, you come to consciousness on the ground. Your weapon is about two feet from your grasp. The first thing you do, your eyes shoot open and then shoot to your weapon. Natural instinct to defend yourself. It's easily within your grasp. You just have to get up to grab it. Can I get all the way over to the bookcase? (counting) 30. You get right to the bookcase. I try to yank it over.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Investigation,"You got ashed and feathered? Tarred and-- What do you call it? Oiled and ashed! It's cool guys. It's fun. Suddenly I'm scared of falling on the beach. I send in two globules after her to see the antiqued goblin. It's a small chamber. It's five foot by five foot. Anyone else is going to be pretty down in there, but you fit in fairly comfortably. There's the shattered urn and a few small pieces of pottery with intricate gold scrolling. They're probably very nice pieces of art or decor. I'm going to check for traps.",MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Arcana,"Sure, as soon as the hole gets bigger. I'll open the other box with my Mage-y Hand-y! Okay. That box opens up, and there's another splash of that same poisonous powder, but you're off to the side. It only gets anyone who's immediately in front of the box. I did it, guys! I feel like Nott's head comes out of the hole, going (rapid gasping) for fresh air. What's in that box? That box contains a folded raiment of some kind, like a ceremonial mantle made of dark black and gray cloth with red embroidered designs on it. Do I recognize any symbols or anything?",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Arcana,"What about that cloak? I put them in the bag. How about that? Okay. You have the folded mantle. What does the mantle look like? The mantle is a dark black, a front chest mantle area, with gray stripes coming along the sides and this red embroidered design that emerges from around the neck, all across the front and back of the mantle. Does it look familiar? No. I was hoping. Can I come up and see if it has any magic feel to it?","MATT: I mean, you can make an arcana check to see"
Investigation,"on the shelf that we knocked over. The shelf is mostly empty. There was that one book on the desk. We could sit down on the floor together and have a look. What else did you get out of there? You have the urns in the cages. You have the tables over there. You have the two braziers filled with ash on the sides. You have the broken cages back there. Everything that you see there is what's in the chamber. I'm going to do a tour of the urns and see if there's anything, jewelry or something, hidden in there.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Arcana,"grasp. You go past the brazier on that side with the ashes, and you poke around with your staff, and something catches your staff underneath the ash. You prod in there, and as you push it aside, there's an object in the ash that is partially burned. As you pull it free and dust it off, it's another book. A large portion of the back of it is burned off, and most of the pages are destroyed on the back end, but a good half of the book is mostly still intact. Like when it got thrown in there to be destroyed, the flame wasn't quite strong enough to consume the entire book. Can I do a little flip through of it? Yeah. As you go through, it's filled with",strange script and scrolling. Make an arcana check.
Perception,"hand. I walk over to Caleb. Hey Caleb. Found this. Oh. Would you like to add it to the pile? Sure. I think it's got stuff for you in it. I'm not really into smut. That's a bit of a ruse. That's unfortunate, actually. I mean, more than normal. Sure. Within reason. Can I walk to the entrance to the tunnel, just to keep an eye out, while he does his thing?",MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.
Medicine,"It's a bunch of gold and jewels. Hey, you know, this is going to take a while, so why don't we put it all down, and I will get to work, okay? I'm poisoned. (laughter) How much you care to drink is on you. I've got an herbalism kit. There's like a purple froth at the corner of her mouth. It's spitting out-- She's antiqued too. She's covered in ash. Covered in oil and ash. Can I use my herbalism kit to get rid of the poison?",MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check.
Religion,"foot-by-foot space. The urn was a big old thing. Clarification: When Caleb did Detect Magic, did the circle in the center of the room glow at all? Or is it-- It's dead. Nope. You see it's been scarred intentionally from the inside. Possibly, whatever flurry of intent that Siff had to burn the book, destroy everything, burn everything from the inside also, was to destroy the circle and allow nothing else to come through. You get the sense that the final moments in this chamber were probably very paranoid. What do we remember about the Crawling King? Do you know anything?",MATT: That would be a religion check.

Insight,"The awe-inspiring one with the face is from a dream you had? Was it the salt-water dream? No. I don't think so. Could be. You need to work on vivid dreams. You can control yourself-- Lucid dreaming, yeah. How do you do that? I don't know. I think it's crystals or something? You can keep a dream journal. That's a good way to do it. When you wake up, you just write. Write it down immediately what you remember. It really helps.",LIAM: I would like to do an insight check on Fjord
Survival,"You could. It would be tiring. We're already out this far. Might as well see where it goes for a little bit. It could be scary. There could be more rock monsters and things. There are literally going to be rock monsters if we go back the other way. Yeah, if we are doing that, then I suggest camping in this chamber before going forward, because we are all bloodied and battered, you know. Sure. We could do that. It has been a really long day so far. What time is it?","MATT: Make a survival check, Nott."
Investigation,"You'd have to climb to get to the top, and you have no idea how to get a boat up there. You get the sense that if you had gone the other way down here, you would've suddenly had a waterfall drop. Is there land off to the sides of the bottom of the waterfall? Very thin, a half a foot to a foot, but there are a lot of stones and rocks that have tumbled through the river over time and set at the bottom that would've destroyed a boat that had fallen off the edge of that waterfall. Good to know. Does it seem like there are any boats that are broken at the bottom of it?",MATT: You can make an investigation check as

Insight,"On one end, it hits rock. Does not. (gasping) There's a little space behind the water. Should we go? There's always shit behind waterfalls. I think we should. Do you think it's going to bludgeon us? I'm already taking off my jacket. I'm taking off everything that I don't want to get wet, keeping just one sword, and I'm going to go for it.

Investigation,"He's folding beer cans into little shapes. What's an alhoon to do? Anyway, you guys come out of the water and quickly glance, as your hair's drenched on the sides of your face-- except for you. It's short enough hair. On the inside, it's fairly empty, except for a skeleton. A humanoid skeleton against a back wall that is laying there. It has manacles or chains attached to its wrists, neck, and feet, and they're all connected by a singular chain in the center, and it's resting there, and it's probably been here for a while. That's bad luck. We seem to keep finding these. I am going to examine this thing.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"going to examine this thing. Make an investigation check. Seven. I mean, the body's pretty rotted. It looks like whatever clothing they're wearing is very basic material that is-- It would be more disintegrated if there wasn't so much moisture in the area, and it looks like bits of it have been eaten away with fungus and mold over time. The manacles are very well made, and looking at the edges where they connect, there's a small rune at that point. No scratches in the walls or any pouches or compartments on the floor around this little space?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"There. 12. Looking at the features of the skull, they're a little bit more delicate than an average human's skull. You get the sense they may be of partial elven blood. Not full elf, but partial elf. Never go full elf. Very true. Well, on your way, Yorick. I set it adrift. Yep, put the manacles over and I'll jump back in. I'm going to also keep my eyes open. I'm going to try to get a little bit down into this to see if there's any bits and pieces underwater. Yeah, that's what I was going to say.",MATT: Make an investigation check when you came

Perception,"making your way down and as you made your way to this portion of the cavern, you walk back, being lead by Kara through the Underworks. Do I see anything of note through Frumpkin's eyes as we walk? Same path as you went last time, not as busy. Nobody else is walking through the halls. It's early enough where there isn't much. You do come past that chamber before where you saw the cages in there and there's two more cages set inside, even larger. One of them is a heavy meshed series of metal. You don't hear anything in there. Can I tell what's inside there?",MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.
Deception,"""Right."" Was there a gelatinous cube at one point? There was, actually, yes. Yeah, this big cube came down from the ceiling and it tried to eat us. ""That's terrifying."" Indeed. It's pretty scary. Good thing you sent the pros. Amateurs probably would have had a worse time. Found lots of skeletons along the way. Yeah. And exactly six rings for you.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"Careful, they're very old. ""Of course. I'm a collector myself. It's fine. This is beautiful make. This is pre-Divergence as well. (chuckles)."" I bet they're worth a whole of money then, huh? ""Oh, most certainly! To the right people, they can be worth quite a bit."" We found some candlesticks too. Also some candlesticks. ""All right."" You produce the candelabra. ""These six rings, you say."" It was seven. I give one of the extra rings.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"Give him the book. (sigh) Caleb, we talked about this. Yeah, and we said that we'd give him the book, so I'm a little confused. No! All right, man. Been in the business longer than we have. I toss him the research notebook. He catches it. Here's the precious research you were looking for. ""All right. Thank you."" You're welcome. ""Is that all of it?"" Yes.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Insight,"826LA. (laughter) I'm sorry kids. It's really a shame. We didn't think this through. At that point, he sits back comfortably. ""Very well. Thank you so much. I'm impressed. I am happy. Keep the rings. I said you can take something back with you, and you've done your job. You've proven yourselves very trustworthy. Please, at your leisure. Take solace in knowing that your friend, Horris, is safely on his way to Berleben."" Seemingly? ""Safely."" Do I believe him?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Intimidation,"I'm going to look at it, and then I'm going to give it back to you. Does it say any more? On this, it has the Xhorhasian note, and it has the Harvest Close coming the third of Fessuran. Those are the two notes of the day. You literally just-- that's all that's on there. ""That's my job."" Hey! ""Ah!"" Where do we sign up for the Victory Pit? ""I don't know."" Tell me. You know! You want to tell her.",MATT: Make an intimidation check. Sure.
Deception,"places to go for medical purposes. Can I use my Mask of Many Faces, and I'll adopt an older face with a gray beard and a dark hood, and can I walk into the physician's office? Yeah, easily enough. You walk into the main area, and one of the clerks there with the same white robes approaches. ""Can I help you, sir?"" (as Sean Connery) Yes, hello. (laughter) Commit to it! (as Sean Connery) Is Ren Sutan there? (laughter) ""What do you require of the Doctor?"" (as Sean Connery) Just get him.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"His eyes go wide. ""We have no business--"" Fetch him. Now. What happened to Sean Connery? I fucking lost it. (as Sean Connery) Fetch him now. I'm a Russian sub commander. ""Very well. I'll go fetch him."" He walks past you out of the-- (as Sean Connery) Do your best. Losers always whine about their best. He walks around you and exits the front of the facility and begins walking down the road, out of sight. I'll turn and follow him.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Medicine,"have? I have no idea. Skein. No, we bought those magic mushrooms. No, it's a fungal powder. Hey Caleb, you want to take a look at the pouch? Skein, I've heard many arguments over the pronunciation. It's a real thing? You didn't make it up? No, the word is a real thing. It's a weaving term. If I take a look at this skein, can I take a guess at what kind of illicit material I'm looking at?",MATT: It's a fungus. Make a medicine check.

Investigation,"would be real funny to plant it on somebody and get them busted later. Was it a powder, or was it like crumbles? It's like a crumbled, dry, almost a spongy-- You guys looked like idiots, just so you know. Shall we get you cleaned up? We need to get Nott cleaned up, too. Nott cleaned up? Yeah Nott's covered in ash. Oh yeah, everybody, let's take a bath. Can I have tried to find any information on the conflict on the Xhorhas border?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Persuasion,"I sharpen it. It's so sharp. I sharpen it every night. ""That's wonderful. I think in the long run, that'll be a very useful feature, but it's also not that uncommon of an object-- "" It's touched by the moon. ""Yeah. I'm touched by the sun every morning.""

She takes the center cup (click). Cup's over it. I'm looking. I'm going to hold my wire up to my mouth. All righty. That being the case, I would",like you both to roll a perception check.
Perception,"I'd like to compete please. I give her my two silver. Do me proud. Yes please. ""A silver?"" Yeah, here. ""Of course."" Coin goes down. Cups over it. Now there's a small crowd gathering. Now people are starting to watch. There was a victory apparently, and some cheers. I am going to back up like five or six steps and also do the same thing Nott did. She begins shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting. Eyes focused on you. Starting to look strangely at you. ""Very well.","Choose."" Now go ahead and roll a perception check."
Sleight of Hand,"(cheering) You were paying attention. All of a sudden, you lost it. Looking up at her eyes, you were so caught off guard by her staring at your fairly well-concealed goblin visage, but seemingly not enough, as she has a curious raised eyebrow. That spooks you for a second. You go ""Oh, shit!"" You lost track of the cups. I got a total of 20. Total of 20. On the perception? Okay. ""What are you going to pick?"" I will choose-- eenie, meenie, miney. Do I get a chance to whisper to her what I saw? Because I want to do the same thing.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
Investigation,"a streamer, and the streamers continue past and flap around, hitting people. It's adorable and delightfully intense. The guard presence is very much felt here, but everyone is in high spirits. You get the sense that everyone has been waiting to get to this festival, to this moment here. It's a much different atmosphere than the gala you had seen a week before in the Tri-Spires. They needed this catharsis, it feels like. TALIESIN Quite a party. I want to find the most ridiculous mead out there. Oh, there are quite a few mead stands, so",it's easy enough for you. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"people of the city of Zadash. You don't see a parental figure in the near vicinity. Where's your mama? Do you have a mama? Is she around? Just runs off. Oh no, I was going to give you more, but okay. Goodbye. Should we go after her? I can hunt her down. No. While I start to enjoy my apple, I would like to look around and see if there are any book stalls or book barrels. Those festive book stalls. A barrel of books!",MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Performance,"walking by and people watching in general. You're on the opposite side of the anvil from the herald who's still chewing on her meat. What do you want to do? I would like to get my paint set out and paint pink hearts all over the back side of the anvil along with ""The Traveler was here"". Then I'm going to leave a couple travel brochures for the Traveler. Yeah, I think that's good but they're sizeable hearts. I want nice pretty pink, all over the hammer. The anvil. Just for the sake of presentation because you're doing this with a bit of haste, knowing that you're under pressure. Go ahead and roll a",performance check.
Sleight of Hand,"but they turned away from you and it seems that you've managed to go this far without being noticed. You finish up your last heart, the exclamation point and the underline of the Traveler. Oh, and I'm going to take some sequins off of my sequins glove and sprinkle it on there. (tinkling) A little granny painting furiously. Just (straining). You put the pamphlets there on the side, slip them beneath the offering bowl at the base of it. I want one sitting right on top of the anvil. Then I'm going to leave.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check on that one.
Investigation,"Yeah, a short jaunt. Not too hard to find a darkened corner where you can do it. Yeah, okay. Then I would like to look exactly like I do, however, the clothing that I'm wearing is a shade of blue that is similar, but not identical, to the robes that I have seen people from the library of the Cobalt Soul. A similar blue and very large coke bottle glasses. My eyes go all fish-eyed. Everything else is the same. Okay. Easy enough to do. I would like to find one of those people who was dressed like they came from that library that I saw that day with Beauregard.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check as you
Deception,"Oh, yeah. Again, I am very sorry. I am a traveling writer. I am writing a history of the great cities of the Empire and I have heard wonderful things about the library that is under your stead and I don't know-- I have viewed it from the outside, it is a beautiful structure, but I don't know what it entails to visit it. I was wondering, do you allow outsiders? I don't know if it costs a fee or if you need some sort of letter of recommendation, but I am very eager to learn about the library itself and the city and everything that I can learn about it so I can write more extensive-- it would just mean so much to me.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Stealth,"Yadaka goes, ""I'm terribly sorry. Page!"" The page looks up. ""What business have you from the Crown?"" Looking over his attire, the page goes, (breathing heavily) ""I must speak with the ""Starosta immediately under order from King Bertrand Dwendal himself."" Yadaka goes, ""Right. ""Come with me. I apologize. You'll have to give us just a moment."" He turns around. ""Urgent matters. ""Enjoy some feasting while you're here.""

Mm-hmm.","MATT: All right, so you roll a stealth check for"
Stealth,"Should we go find out what's going on over there? I don't think we can. I could sneaky-sneak over there and listen. Yeah, go for it. Can you give her some blessing-type of situation? Oh yes (jibberish). I will cast Silent Image and I'm going to go up to the corner, make the image of a three-foot by three-foot box around me. You're going full Solid Snake here?

Give your applause to our keeper of freedom and ""order, Lawmaster Orentha Stonegrasp."" He points across the way up in the stands. The cheers go bright and you see a figure stand up, and you can see the gray haired dwarf who you had met in the King's Hall earlier. She's the Lawmaster of Zadash who had come out to thank you for the job you had done in slaying the phase spider in the sewers. She raises a hand and then sits down. Make a",perception check as she waves her hand and gray

Arcana,"forward towards them. They all immediately assault this entity, jumping in the air, vaulting off sides of the walls, assaulting it. One gets smacked in the face, it grabs another and throws it onto the ground. Another one rushes up as it grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight on top of it, one foot pushing it down. Gunther rushes up with a blade and carves into a large section of its face. The crowd goes crazy as it pulls back and shoves Gunther off with a back fist. The elven leader rushes forward and does a few quick swipes with his blade. The large toad creature grabs it and attempts to swallow him, and manages to do so, completely ingests the leader.",The rest begin to assault. Make an arcana check.
Medicine,"poisoning is Lesser Restoration, which I can cast on Yasha right now. I can get rid of the poison on you. Wait, but the poison will go away eventually, right? Won't it?

Animal Handling,"I rolled a natural one, so--. Top of the round, as the wolves begin to emerge, Beau, you're up first. Okay. I'm going to run (counting) 40, I guess? All righty. Look at the blood on there already. I'm-- Yeah, that's cool-- I'm going to look at this one and I'm going to go, hey (whistles), go fetch!

Sleight of Hand,"slits. (hoarse greeting) Fucking old. I have no other way to describe him. Old as balls. Is his hair long or short? His hair's long past his shoulders, but it's super bald skullet on top. You see there's a tattooed halfling, who's got his chin in the air, grin and give you a show, and there's the human archer that has a longbow that's at the ready. All of them walk by, all six of them, into the center of the arena. As we walk by, can I try to untie the old guy's shoelaces?",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
History,"around in town where you grew up so you gather these people are from Menagerie Coast folk. The one who looks very exotic has very light linen outfit that is a dull eggshell white, but then has trim that is gold and purple. The pants are a deep blue. Short black hair, dark skin, bright smile, but you don't notice any other cultural touchstones that you have any previous experience with. Have I ever seen an outfit like that before? You may have seen things similar to it passing through your town from a distance or from your mom's place of business, but nothing that you","would necessarily know. Roll a history check,"
Perception,"Xhorhasian assassin, and I am not. What the fuck is the Kryn though? The Kryn is the kingdom over there. Kryn. It's the Kryn dynasty. Oh, the Kryn.

Do you approve of how the Empire is going? I'm not super invested in the political spectrum, I just don't want any part of it. So no? I think it could be better.

We had a crazy orgy in our room and you guys didn't even want to be part of it.",SAM: Insight check! 11.
Insight,"I think we should be careful, because the longer we're in town, the more people we talk to, the more people might decide that they're invested in us staying. Fair enough.

We have to take a trip to Pumat's for supplies and then--",TRAVIS: Insight check! Just kidding. I'm good.
Insight,"don't take lightly the ask that we're giving here--"" We understand your position, unfortunately you find us in a precarious time. As you can see, we don't have all of our fellows here with us and this morning's news caught us unawares. We'd need a fair bit of time to consider your offer, I'm afraid.

I'll do it.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Persuasion,"Well, perhaps we'll partake of some beverages and discuss. ""Of course."" One more thing though, our other offer was for 10,000 gold. Seems like maybe you could match that just to make it a little bit more equal? ""You mistake this business as some sort of a push for an inherently equal pay, my friend. I ""don't know what business the Crown wishes to offer you, but I can guarantee you it has a ceiling.""

Survival,"We're going north. We're the worst. It'll only get colder the further north you go. Even at night here-- most mornings in Wildemount, at least this area of Wildemount, all the grass is frosted, the windows are frosted.

There's a tanning easel set there for whoever has been utilizing it. There is a front door. You see a window that has no glass in it.

For the narrative purposes of this, nothing is currently engaging you in combat. The wolf that is on death's door is currently unconscious and bleeding out from the spell that you gave it. I would have said if we'd gotten around to it that if I could go another 30 feet in this direction, if I could still see the last goblin that went this way, I would fire off more magic missiles to finish it.

It looks like the top of the lake bends to a point northward and then begins to head southward and level out. At this point, Febron goes, ""All right, good. From here, we head northward into the swamp. We're looking for ""daggers with pearl hilts in the trees. Those are the markers  there's six of them that lead us ""there."" He's going to make a perception check. He looks a bit lost  someone want to help him out with this? Yeah, I'll look.",MATT: Make a perception check as well.
Investigation,"Just one dead person that I cast it on. Which body is fresher, Matthew? From what you're looking at, they're both about as fresh as the other. Which one's got the better mouth? It doesn't have to be fresh, it could be really old. They both have their jaws intact. From what you can tell, the female halfling, you can't make out the features of the face because the hair is in the way and dangling. The other one's is open. Which one looks friendlier? They both look pretty dead! Let me check for traps on the smaller one.",MATT: Make an investigation check.

Beyond the leg missing, there are a number of wounds. You can",make a medicine check to try and ascertain what they are.
Intimidation,"Potentially. That's as close as you can get right there. Am I within ten feet of it? You are. Okay. Can I use necrotic shroud, then, if I use that as the action to run? You don't have an action to use it anymore, unfortunately. Okay. Can I just yell at it? Yeah. What do you yell? I give you two bonus actions. Super intimidating. Oh, but then I've got to fucking attack something. All right, I'm going Drop it!",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Arcana,"Sacred Flame? Yeah, I'll hold Sacred Flame until Beau is dropped and far enough away. You got it. Holding there, Cali, you're up. How close can I get to it with the difficult terrain? Can I get next to Yasha? You can get that close right now with the speed of 30 feet, yeah. No, it's fine. I will get there and she twitches a little bit. Come on! Quickened Levitate on Beau. I'm going to try and lift Beau up. If there's a tree line above, I'm going to try and fling her up to the tree line. Interesting! For the purposes of this, make",an arcana check and this is going to be your

At that point the head (sighs) continues back. Well, at least we know it's 100 feet, so we can search for it. Are there actual knives stuck in-- Looks to be two shortswords have been jammed into it. Shortswords or daggers? Shortswords. Do they have anything in their pockets?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Maybe like, two past noon? Maybe. Caleb knows exactly what time it is. Liam likes to burn his friends. Caleb also likes to burn his friends. Aw.

Is the water around the tree in a circle, like it pans out from around the side? Kind of. There's a big clearing around this tree. It's natural for the most part, but it looks like this area is centered around the tree. Do I see anything like landmarks or anything out of place surrounding the tree?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"so-- cute. Oh, well Nott, if I'm allowed to call you that-- Sure. I can make the water clear so that you can see if there's anything that could grab you. Oh! What was that thing you said about honesty earlier? I can't remember. You don't know any of the fact that I almost killed you, Marisha Ray. I'm talking about before you almost killed me when you had that great quote about honesty earlier.","MATT: Beau, make an athletics check to try and"
Investigation,"I'll pull on that branch. Oh jeez. Vigorously pull on it! Maybe there's two branches. The gif machine. Huh? The gif machine, Sam Riegel. (strained yelling) Oh god. The branch itself is pretty sturdy. The portions of the tree here do not bend very much and it doesn't seem to react. The strength of the Mage Hand isn't very strong. Are there any knots on the tree? Like underneath where the ribbon was?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"12? Yeah. You glance around and as you were placing your hands against part of it some of it shifts, it wobbles. Now getting a glance, there's a piece of weathered driftwood or separate wood that has been pressed up and tucked behind some of the roots to look like it's part of the tree. But it's a little bit of a different texture, a different type of wood and as you press on it, it wiggles. You shift it-- Traps! Check for traps, Nott. All right. Truly blessed with such wisdom. I will check for traps.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Okay. You're now stepping into the chamber. The chamber's about 30 feet wide. It's just round. Looking up? You look up. The ceiling's about 12 feet tall and there's some hanging roots that are dangling from the top. It looks like it's been carved away maybe. Does it feel like it's bigger on the inside? No. It matches the size. It's probably about two feet to three feet of thickness of the actual tree trunk and the interior's hollow. Do I notice any furniture, articles, clothing?",MATT: No. Make an investigation check if you want
Investigation,"Yeah, do the tracks lead to the hole? There are some spatters of blood and there are some things that give the sign of being pulled on as well as pieces and shards of wood, including bits of porcelain, some object that had shattered and broken. Looks like whatever may have been within this chamber at some point, a lot of it's been brought down there. Nott Bren, you're up. I've got to go down there? Yep. By yourself. That's where the fish people live! Are there fish scales on the ground? Do you need light?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"accumulation of neck tattoos. You've seen the ones back in Zadash that were almost full bands of designs. These individuals have only sections of it. You start getting the idea that the more they've worked with whatever organization that work this is, the more completion they've had of certain jobs depending on what the job is, a certain type of individual acquires tattoos as a sign of how long they've been there and how successful they've been. That's cool. Okay. So they all seem like smugglers? At one point possibly. Can I do a quick round of their pockets?",MATT: Investigation check.
Athletics,"It doesn't take much to distract Cali. You just point over there and she's like-- I'll take a swig and go down the hole. The hole has chunks of rock and dirt as well as a very interwoven network of roots coming down from the tree, so it's fairly easy to climb down. There is a little bit of that damp water and moisture that seeped into the chamber previously from just being near the swamp. It wasn't a thick layer of water, maybe half an inch or so in the actual portions of the chamber and some of it is now heading down. As you're climbing down carefully through this hole, you can feel it running down your back and it's this cold swamp",water. I need you to make an athletics check as

If you're going to come down to join me, use a rope. All right, we can do that. Just stay put, don't go rushing in without us. Is it one or more than one? I don't know. I'll go rushing in and find out. That's the opposite of what I said! I'm going to gingerly creep around the corner.","MATT: Make a stealth check for me, please."
Acrobatics,"Yeah, we've established that. Stay put, don't move. I'll cast Mage Hand and take a ball bearing across the way, but not dropping it, just holding it in place, just in case. Okay. So who's going down? I drop Frumpkin down the shoot. Oh Jesus, he's going to die! No, he's not. That's not a long fall for a cat. We're going to find out how far. Not within like 50 feet. Yes, they can. Yeah they can, most of them. Make an",acrobatics check for me.
Stealth,"You assume. We're glossing over it, but we've seen you vomit sea water twice. Once. Is this really the moment to talk about this? Jester's really smart! Right now's the moment. Right now?

Stealth,"Jester and Cali. Wait, does Kiri get a turn? No, Kiri's staying in the back. All right, that's everybody. Top of the round, as all three of them have spun around, apparently aware that something is lurking in this area of it. It still doesn't see us, right? For six seconds. No, but it's not an ambush round. So. Top of the round is Beau, you're up. Can I hold my turn until Fjord goes? You can't hold your turn. You can hold an action.

Nott, you see one thing, helping Caleb out, and you pull it out. It looks to be a well-crafted marble bowl of gold inlay of a curious design. The edges of the bowl shift into five multiple dragon heads, equally separated and in each dragon, the eyes are tiny gemstones. One set's rubies, one set's emeralds, one set's sapphires, one set's diamond. I will try to conceal this from Cali.","MATT: All righty, make a sleight of hand check."

We'll take a short rest afterwards. Just a quick little recon. Here. Tie it around. I drop the rope and jump in.

Stealth,"Those were the bone chimes! Oh no! That's scarier than wind chimes. Should we be stealthy? Yeah, we should be stealthy. Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? Yes. Is that all of us? Yeah. Stay within 30 feet of me, okay? Big times are coming, Nott. I don't want to, don't make me go in there. It's a troll house. Nott! What? Bless you. Now you have advantage on",stealth checks.
Stealth,"And I'm within 30 feet of Nott. So you move over here with Yasha, then? Sure, I guess? Okay, there's now this floating piece of dynamite just kind of gliding over the swamp. You hear the insects buzzing and various dragonflies making their way through. So you have it now floating in front of you, Yasha. Okay, I'll light it. It's going! Okay! I'm going to move toward the thing and make Mage Hand go in front of me all the way into the hole. Okay. You get right around this corner. Make",another stealth check as you've now dilly-dallied
Athletics,"Nine. Not as much as Yasha. This'll be fun. Let's run up to it, see how close I can get. In order to make it with your distance, you're going to have to leap across that bit of open swamp water. I'm going to try to leap at that just north of me to see if I can get over here, then. By that spiritual weapon. If I can leap there. That'll be the rest of your movement. You'll be right there and that'll be the end of your movement. That's fine. At least it'll hopefully give everybody some flanking.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check."

Does it look like it's regenerating at all? Six points. Thank you.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Medicine,"Beau gets up, seeing Caleb a little bit messed up, and I'm going to go up to him and I'm let's take a walk. You pull him away. He's not present, currently. That's fine. I'm walking with him a little bit, slowly. I'm going to take my axe and I'm going to try to cut out his heart. Just in case. Very slowly, so it doesn't splatter. You have to wait a moment, because currently the body is being engulfed. Eventually the flames die down to the point where you can carve into its body, but most of its flesh is burned. It's",definitely dead. Make a medicine check.
Investigation,"destroyed swamp ground that much of it has been scattered all across. You do manage to find some coins between the two of you-- mostly you, Nott-- and it takes some digging. You're basically having to pan for gold here. You're going in the muck and having to sift through your fingers and pour your water out a bit, take it into the water. You manage to find roughly 26 gold pieces, ten silver pieces, and let's say about 50 copper pieces. Quarter of what we came back for, but sure! Does his body have a pouch on him at all? Can I search the body? The body of the troll? Make another",investigation check.
Medicine,"13. There's basic hides wrapped around the midsection. There is a small pouch.

We'll find our way over to a table. Yeah, I'll go get a table. Does someone want to tuck Kiri in? Kiri at this point is leaning up on the counter towards the woman.

It's fairly empty, so she grabs another and then heads over to your table and begins to uncork and fill the drinks. As she's filling, I'll Mage Hand back and try to grab the book.

Persuasion,"Make a stealth check. That's not great. 14. You could just be looking. Okay, she walks and is pouring drinks and looks over her shoulder in your direction, and is still pouring, but is looking at you. Kids, huh? They're always wandering off. ""Apparently."" Goo goo ga ga. Do I see where the book is now? You do see it from your perspective, but she is watching you. Uma, has anyone ever told you that you have eyes like the sea?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"Damn it! Fjord, what was that? What was that? That's not how you talk to a woman! I'm not real practiced, I'm sorry. ""Your eyes are like the sea?"" We're in a landlocked part of the place here. She doesn't even know what that means. I should've said like the swamp, right? Your eyes are like stagnant water, green and-- no? Green and yellow in places. I walk directly up to the bar. They look like a troll took a shit in them. ""Can I help you?"" Yeah, I'm good on drinks. I was just curious what it is that you're reading.",MATT: Roll a persuasion check.
Perception,"for it to get here? ""Well, the order goes out there, and pay upon delivery. It took me the better part of a ""month to get here."" I commiserate for your thirst for fiction.

Arcana,"Oh yes, please. I'm a little unnerved about this sword. Would you stay and watch for a second? This seems like a bad idea. Sure. All right. I'll summon the Wastehunter Falchion.

What? What's ahead? A caravan of four carts, heading your direction, heading southward and going to cross your path. Can we see?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"They don't. They look like wagons. And as they begin to approach, they turn and give you a wide berth like they're about to make room to travel past you guys. It could be a diamond shipment. Maybe we should ask. Howdy! What news from the road up ahead? The gentleman at the front puts a hand up and the carts slow down a little bit.

Well, that happens at nightfall. Is it mostly gnomes that live in the city? I think mostly gnomes, but I'm pretty sure there are other people. I don't know. I've never been here.

The interior metal rod is currently resting on the ground next to it and they're building an outer frame. Looking past, on the far end-- on the northern end, you can see a huge cannon, maybe about 15 feet across and about three to four feet wide in the middle. That one is on a platform.

You're not sure-- actually, roll a history check, because I'm curious to see how much you know about this. (sing-songy) Don't fuck me, Gil. Yes! He did it. Fucked me pretty hard. That's three.

Glancing about, you see more crownsguard attire, though now you're starting to get to more gnomish crownsguard who are established there.

I flank. Okay, so you head off into the brush? Stealth.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"enter? What?! Whoa! That was fast. This is Your Life! Ashly Burch joins us at the table. Hey, Ashly. Welcome. So Ashly, if you'd like to describe what Molly sees as he approaches? What Molly sees is a dwarven woman with a five o'clock shadow, a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, extremely battered, bloodied, rusted armor, full armor, and short, greasy hair. And she has a big ol' axe in one hand, and a big ol' hammer in the other. Does she see these folk now?",MATT: Roll a perception check for me.
History,"Hey, we're five! Yeah, kind of. We're probably a good three and a half, if we're being honest. Don't put yourself down like that. I'm sure you can hold your own. I'm talking about you mostly, sweet cheeks. There's five. Are they part of a larger organization, or are they off themselves? It's just them? They work for someone, a family in Shady Creek Run. They're powerful. They're mobsters! have I heard about this group, considering my background?",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"Swimming in it. Yeah. Why are you hiding your face? I didn't leave with a lot of friends last time I was here. So I'm trying to keep a low profile. You're well disguised as a stoner's bedroom at the moment. A dragon on a sheet. Perfect, I'll fit right in. There you go. I guess I can lead, since I know where I'm going. Okay. You've traveled this path before, so it's well known. Who's keeping watch? I'll keep watch.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check
Survival,"haven't-- you're basically having to go to the center and then back north, but you're on the road the whole time. Or if you wanted to skip past it, you'll travel a little slower-- basically a similar pace. But we won't encounter as many foes. Well you don't know. Okay. It just depends on your-- Are we trying to avoid people or-- I'm more than happy to kill something at this point. I've got some anger and aggression to work out. What's the faster route?",MATT: Make a survival check.
Investigation,pretty thrashed. There's nothing in here! Are there any books? I'm going to hop in there as well. I'll go take a look. Books! I'll look for you. We always know to look. I'm not going to look for boo-- Oh god. Are you looking for-- Keg sits down on one of the pieces of furniture. I also want to see if there's-- does it look like people have been in here recently?,MATT: Well you make an investigation check on

Well you make an investigation check on,that. And you make an investigation check to look
Perception,"correct? Yeah. All right, so Caleb-- you're having this moment where you're waiting as he's just poring over this tome and drawing a circle on the ground and inscribing strange symbols in the air. It doesn't make any sense. You're like, ""Ah, magic stuff."" Right. Want another drink? Yes. (pouring noise) Thank you. Bless you.","MATT: Everybody else roll a perception check, if"
Stealth,"away from us, and I'm going to give it a good kick and jump off of it. And head towards the tree line with everybody else. I'm going to head it away from us. Okay. Your horse begins to head in a southward direction. I'm staying where I am, and I'm taking out my battleaxe and my warhammer. I'm going, ""Come ""out, you piece of shit!"" So you're staying by the house? Yeah. I'm staying in the house, and I'm going to cover myself up with some detritus of different chairs and things, near the window. I'm hiding.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Acrobatics,"there. Pretty much right to the edge of where that is there. So I can't get up on any of these boys? I'll say because a horse doesn't get any attack on-- and it would normally get an action, I'll let the horse dash. Ey! That's nice. So that'll get you right up next to this one. Okay. So can I leap off the horse and come down with the axe? Yes! Yeah. Just for the hell of it, make an",acrobatics check for me.
Medicine,"pull it out. If you squeeze and twist, you can make it stand up again and you can make the arms move. Technically-- (singing) Hello my baby! You guys nasty, I like it. Does anybody have a Wet-Nap? Use the ground. I'm going to take off running after the horses to see if I can catch up with them. Okay. Please check on Water Closet! This is a dead horse or can it be revived?",MATT: You can go ahead and make a medicine check.

Sure, if you want to go ahead and step up to",the horse. Make a medicine check.
Medicine,"Nott, you do manage to catch up to the other horses. They didn't go full sprint into infinity. They slowed down and once they got a safe distance from the action-- you manage to recover two of them. There's still your horse by the house  you still have three horses. Check Water Closet. John, Crapper, and Toilet. Water Closet's dead. Oh, he's very dead. You can go check. Water Closet is possibly new pocket jerky at this point. We can go check Water Closet I guess?",MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check as you
Nature,"I have a dagger. Here, use mine. I do have a dagger. I shoot out the globules of light to float around the corpse. And I put my goggles on. Safety first. It's very bright. Super bright. Super bright right now. Pull up the hood and I buckle myself up. I take my scarf from around my waist and tie it around me for a facemask. You can do this, and I walk twenty feet back.

Athletics,"Oh, well, we can make some more headway on the road and then go at full dark. We could camp at full dark. Wherever we happen to find ourselves. Are we within range of the forests? Yes, about here is where the forest begins, and that is where you began your confrontation. You're right on the edge of the forest. I think we should continue to make time as well. Okay. Can I climb a tree and do I see anything on the horizon in where we're going, like another tree clearing that looks like it might be up ahead?",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Perception,"effortlessly diving through this forest. Keg is aroused. Whatever you cast on me, Caleb, is like... I feel so good! It's gone. But the lingering effects, you know, I'm in the afterglow! The afterglow of Haste. It was just tea. We just gave you tea to smoke, it wasn't really... (laughter) Herbal tea, man. Just chamomile tea. So relaxed. You make it up into the canopy. Make a",perception check.
Stealth,"We got to act right now. What does the woman look like? I'm going to groggily stumble over, put on my googles as I start stumbling towards the light. She looked dead. She did not look natural. I'm going to stay 30 feet behind and try and stealth. Beauregard, you're leading up? Yeah, I'm going to walk and I'm like: It's bright enough, and I got to pee anyway. I'll be right back. So not stealthing? Maybe you should not go first. Okay, no, I'll stealth a little bit.","MATT: Roll a stealth check, Beau."

I'm going to not follow, but go off to the side and try to go around the other way.",MATT: Stealth check from you.
Stealth,"house. A short rest-- You didn't call it out. But he was on first watch. I happily went, ""I get to use arcane recovery"" in my head because of the conversation that was happening. I will allow a short rest before you guys went to bed. It's fine, I'll allow it. 16. Thank you, Matt. The two of you have branched off and are stealthing, you think. What are you doing, Caleb? I wanted to go with Nott, about 20 feet behind, and cast Mage Armor as I go.","MATT: Okay, and what's your stealth check?"
Stealth,"Whoa! That die never does that for me. You did this last time. You're not human! The anti-Wheaton has been found. You can't come back! You can never touch Wil Wheaton, or you guys will cancel each other out like the bad guy in Time Cop. Oh my god. Strangely, the stealthiest of all of you is the dwarf in plate armor. Amazing. It's lubricated with all the blood of her enemies. Exactly. All right, Molly, you're staying 30 feet back? I'm staying 30 feet back and attempting",a stealth check. That's cocked. That's better.
Persuasion,"Yes. 15? You feel some sort of magical force suddenly penetrate your mind, and this sparkle of colors begin to spray in front of your face that completely distract you and obscure your vision momentarily, but you blink out of it and find the effect drift off of your brain. The old woman goes ""(panting),"" and reaches down and puts herself in front of the boy, between you and the child. Yeah, I'm not bad. I'm not one of the bad guys... That you were definitely talking about. That I'm aware of, right? What bad guys are you talking about?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Insight,"""They were lucky."" We'll see. ""Had you been awake, you might have had the urge or instinct to defend them."" Well, we're making our way to see if something can be done. Yeah. ""Well, you're as brave as Nila."" Nila? She's the one going after them? ""She was. I don't know where she is or if she has fared well-- if they've found her.

Doesn't say anything, but looks over and inspects them and then brings them back and hands them out to you. It's breakfast. I will definitely take some. I'll take one. Yes, thank you. Do you understand what I am saying? Do you speak? Is his ward awake? You don't see her at the moment, but you do hear a bit of rustling in the actual little hovel in the tree archway.",ASHLY: Can I make a perception check around to
Perception,"in the tree archway. Can I make a perception check around to make sure everything is copacetic? You can. 16. You notice that the horses have actually been brought closer. They've been hitched together to one of the local stumps, to the circle here. It seems that in your rest, your very deep rest through the evening, a lot of things have been tended to and taken care of in your presence. They've got turn-down service here. As part of your long rest, and the tea which you took in the evening, you do have advantage on",perception checks for the next eight hours.
Sleight of Hand,"All things being equal. ""Anyway. I thank you. Ombo thanks you. And--"" I look at the kid. Is he freaked out by the way I look? Is he--? No, not at all. I'm going to go down and try something. He does have a giant owl on his shoulder and is currently preoccupied with the owl. I'm going to try this. I haven't tried this yet. I'm going to hold up the moon card, and I'm going to try and do a sleight of hand trick and flip it to one of my little moon trinkets, moon baubles.",MATT: Ooh. Make a sleight of hand check.
Perception,"Do I die on the spot? Disadvantage on your checks. On ability checks, that's all. And you're hangry. That's my secret, Taliesin. I'm always hangry. As the sky grows dark, the still gray clouds that have taken the sky overhead, the temperature is dropping significantly. It looks like it's going to be a particularly cold night. Do you wish to continue pushing on? Along the way, do we see anything that looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would be nice?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"that would give you safe and out of the public eye. Does it look like if we push a little bit further, there's any change in terrain? There's only one way to find out. Even in far distance? You can travel for another hour. Yeah, there's a way to do that. Want to do one more hour and call it? Or Owl Boy. He's hangry. We could push it, too. I'm good. Let's send the owl. Okay. Five minute little fly-ahead?",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Perception,"It's terrible. It's perception, was that what I was doing? Five. At this distance, it looks like it's straight, moving, rolling hills and bursts of stone. It's getting dark out here, and I'm tired. If we can find a stone for cover, maybe. I'll take watch. We'll set up a proper camp. I'll take watch with Keg. Great. Before I go to sleep, I do the silver thread. First watch is you two. Do you wish to","combine your perception checks for this watch, or"
Perception,"You gave me the heaviest shit first though! That's what you wanted, I thought! Of course! (yelling) We're trying to sleep for gods' sakes! (hoot owl call) Well, this has been fun. Yeah, I'm up too. Molly, you want to take next watch? Let's take the next one. All right. Yeah, I'm going to fucking bed. All right. So, Molly and Beau taking the second watch, would you mind deciding who's making","perception checks, please?"
Perception,"Yeah... anyway. To not quite being the worst people. Cheers. Cheers. Night. Just maybe don't have a job that relies on relationships, either. That's very fair. Public opinion-- They really had it coming. Yeah. The rest of your watch goes uneventful, leaving to Caleb the final watch. I'll take this myself.",MATT: All right. Make a perception check. Actually
Perception,"and you can see a cluster of horses and a couple of carts heading your direction, heading southward. You're not quite there yet, but you're getting close to where the direction you should continue on breaks off of Glory Run, but you're still on the road. You do see a small caravan making their way southward in your direction. Once they get a little closer, let's slow down and walk to the side of the road and take a look at this. Okay. You guys move off to the side. Can I tell from looking at the cart if there's anything off about it?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"bring common supplies, things from the northern side, bringing them southward. It looks like they have supplied up for a trade run and they're heading southward. As they ride past you guys to the right side, they give a nod. Caleb, should I go check them out? The next rider gives a nod. They're not who we're looking for. Oh, okay. You can if you want to. Are they suspicious? Not from what I can see. What kind of traders do they look like? What are they trading in?","MATT: With the perception roll you made, it's hard"
Perception,"Not from what I can see. What kind of traders do they look like? What are they trading in? With the perception roll you made, it's hard to see because they've covered it specifically. You can see underneath edges and pieces that are pushing out, and the shape in places. It looks like they're bringing farming supplies. It looks like they're bringing possibly grains and foods. It looks like things that would be easy pickings. They're not the kind of people that can defend it, so it's maintain mystery and keep pushing. All right. We can go. Okay. You continue on. On this next leg of","your journey, we're riding on your perception roll"

On this next leg of your journey, we're riding on your perception roll off the road, your natural 20. I'll let that stand for a bit. The pace that you've been keeping on this without being kept by your cart has gained you quite a bit of ground and about another two hours or so into this afternoon, your eyes catch another cluster of carts facing the same direction you are.",ASHLY: Can I make a perception check on this one?
Perception,"The spell comes to a close now because you have fulfilled the suggestion. Ah, you guys are assholes. We told you that. That's fair. We said that multiple times. Can we see if it's them? Yeah, how? Can you go owl it out? Yeah, lay low. We're starting to get a plan. I plant my hand on Nott's head and go into Frumpkin's eyesight and send him up there. Okay. Frumpkin takes off and begins to coast at a fair enough distance to keep an eye down. Make a",perception check for Frumpkin with advantage.
Stealth,"So keeping your distance behind them, pulling your pace back to just the normal, even slow pace, it's up to you. Probably normal to keep in pace with them. At a medium pace. It was going to happen eventually. You're gross, Marisha. I'm the worst. About a few more hours, sundown hits, we'll say for the purposes of the narrative here. They pull off to the side of the road and begin to set up camp. Keeping an eye on this in the distance, you watch them. Keeping far enough away, making sure you're not in eyeshot of them, as part of","that, I will say two of you helm a stealth check to"

Yeah, it'll be the two of you.",MARISHA: Helming a stealth check?
Athletics,"some chops and then-- Yeah, you can do that angle-- --it can block the other half. --you can do that angle so that you can just hit it and know which side it will fall to-- Sure.

What do I roll?",MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check for
Stealth,"(laughter) Actually, all of these tree pieces were sent by our friends at Steamforge as gifts. I was like, ""I get to use these at some point,"" and you guys are using them tonight. Falling and snapping right at the front half of the cart, breaking through. I'm going to give Protto an attempt to try and dodge out of the way. He succeeds with a dexterity saving throw, because he's quite dexterous. He jumps back into the front of the cart, and you watch his lower half vanish as he stops there. Am I revealed, or am I hidden by the stump? You don't know. Actually, that's a valid",point. I'm going to have you guys all roll stealth checks.
Acrobatics,"stepped through part of a doorway. On the inside, you see a very sweaty human man who is gagged and leaned up against the cage like, (whines). He looks up towards you. That's all I've got. That's all you've got. Can you get a little bit more around the-- or is that all your movement? I'm sure I pushed as far as I could. Okay. I'm probably more than 40 feet away from the druid? You can just get to the druid at 40 feet. (counting) You do have to get down there. Sweet jump.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"very much elements of his profession, or at least reminding you what he does. So the oil weirdly does make it strangely erotic. It's your turn, you have 25 feet of movement, so that'll only get you about five squares of movement. Okay, I'm going to run. I'm going to run-- Away? Away. Jesus. Ugh, you're the worst! I'm roleplaying! Are you running towards the action or away from it? I'll run towards this-- no, I'm going to run towards those horses. I'm going to run that way.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check to leap down.
Stealth,"Nope! That's a three. You can't push through it  the cages are too close. The small gap there, you try to muscle it, but there are two to three people in each cage, and you can't push though. Can I use my bonus action to-- Jesus, what can I do for my bonus action? I can't hide. Can I hide? You could try, you're partially obscured. I got nothing else to do on a bonus action. So yeah, I will try to hide. Lorenzo's eyeing him right now, you said? I'll go on the side of the cart and-- Lorenzo's eyeing in that direction. I'll hide off the side of the cart.","MATT: Okay, make a stealth check."
Acrobatics,"I have my bonus. Can I move and then attack again? Yeah, if you want to. Or you could hit them while they're down and help them bleed out. I thought about that, but I have enough movement that I can make it to the barbarian, right? You could. Are you going to handle Lorenzo? Who's going to handle Lorenzo? (shouting) Who's going to handle Lorenzo? Fuck! I'm going to jump over the horses' asses and get to Lorenzo. You are. Oh dear.",MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"is going late, but I want to see how this turns out. We've been gone for two weeks. Consider it a bonus episode. There's no way I can make it to Lorenzo from here, is there? It's possible. Not anymore. You can climb over the cart if you want to. I'm going to get my ass kicked if I get there. I'm going to try and engage the barbarian before raging happens. It's up to you. God damn it. Fuck it, if you're in with Lorenzo, I'm going for Lorenzo.","MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check to try and"
Persuasion,"situations before. What are you going to do? Can I reach them with my speed? Can you reach who? Lorenzo and Beau. No. How close can I get? With the tree there, about there is as close as you can get. You can use your action to move, but you wouldn't be able to do anything else. But I can talk to him? You can. You move up over the log, and it gets you there. I say: Stop! Stop! Make me the example. Stop. Just stop attacking them.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"Oh, you are a horse! Of course. I can turn into a horse once more. But if I do, I think that is the last time I can do it today. Until you take a rest. Until my next rest. Horse nap.

There is snow on the ground. You can see there's bits that are gathered on them. Why would they just be left in the road? Caleb has told us all of this? Yes. I am going to scout up ahead and see if I recognize them.","MATT: Okay, make a medicine check for one thing as"
Perception,"Eventually the light of the sky begins to grow dim as the evening calls to you, at which point the flurry has come. The snow begins to get heavier, the darkness is darker than normal at dusk and the air gets bitter cold. What do you wish to do to set camp? Do we still have the tents? Did we keep the tents? We have the tents. We've taken everything, yeah. Can I see through the dark with my night vision? You can see up to a 60-foot distance I believe, and it's a dim light. Are there any structures around?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"moment to walk around, you do see one hill that has a bank that is eroded, and there is a bit of an outcropping that may be about three or four feet outward. If you were to all crowd in, it might be able to prevent piercing wind and/or continuous snowfall, but it would be pretty cozy. Do you guys feel like cuddling? Share body heat, keeps us warmer. Ugh. I'll keep watch. I'm kind of wide, so you'll have more room. Okay. Let's cuddle. You guys gather up here on the underside of this outcropping of the hill. Who's taking first","watch? You, Keg? Make a perception check for your"
Perception,"spoon-like position at times, you glance out and see a few shapes moving past. You see a few stars blink out as shadows move past.

The snow is falling and they're trying to find themselves to warmer climate. Were-goats. You don't know that. ASHLY. Dangerous, violent were-goats. You don't find any other threat or anything during your watch. Next watch? I'll take it.","MATT: Beau, make a perception check."
Perception,"thankful, at this moment, that you found this outcropping in Keg's vision, because the distant hills that are open are now heavily piling with this soft, powdered snow. It's starting to fall and the wind is pushing through and some of it's hitting the left side of your face. It's starting to go a little numb and you have to brush it off every now and then and try to do your best to dry up the biting cold water that is melting against your cheek. Nevertheless, your watch comes to an end without an issue. Who wants to take the final watch? I will. You and me, goblina. Sure.","MATT: Make a perception check for me, please?"
Stealth,"up. Sorry, out of character. Excuse me. Let's see! It's a dick man with a drink. (laughter) It was a me and Laura collab. Somebody was talking, having a moment. Then you draw a dick man. I'll make myself look like Rissa. Okay, perfect. Because I know that one. Rissa and Robert Duvall. Those of you who are trying to be inconspicuous, which would be Beau and Keg, go",ahead and make general stealth checks.

What should we know? ""Nothing. They're gracious employers, I enjoy my time here, but just listen carefully. I'm ""trying to help, that's all. Good day! Be off, be off!"" No, I know, but why?

History,"mercenaries for the war. Okay. Coasting around the north side. You tell the group to make a wide berth outside of the trench. Which is on the northern end of the plaza. Following the directive of Keelyn you start weaving toward what's called North Clover. Clover Street, you've now begun to note is the large central street that is the one throughline of the entire city. It runs all around the treeline of the Savalierwood. It's strange and not straight in places, and it was designed to follow the southern border of this forest. The northern side of it, North Clover is built directly into this forest.","You know-- Make a history check, actually. Caleb,"

Following the directive of Keelyn you start weaving toward what's called North Clover. Clover Street, you've now begun to note is the large central street that is the one throughline of the entire city. It runs all around the treeline of the Savalierwood. It's strange and not straight in places, and it was designed to follow the southern border of this forest. The northern side of it, North Clover is built directly into this forest. You know-- Make a history check, actually. Caleb,",you can make a history check too.
Nature,"almost a decaying sense to its meeting between grey and purple. It's beautiful in light, and then when it hits the ground it almost looks like it's bereft of life. You don't understand the nature of this enchantment, whatever this curse may be that you've heard of. Nila. Is there something wrong with the soil here or something? Do you know anything about this? I don't like the look of it. Feels bad. Do I have something that can tell? Do you know? (laughter) Well, you're not familiar with this where you are from? No, no.",MARISHA: You could do a general nature check.

Perception,"still brims with health. It also off-puts you. You get chills and you don't know why. I don't need to check my smell bag for this. All right. I think stink pouch is still my favorite phrase. Stink pouch, fine. No, smell bag is great. Odor sack? It's somehow worse than stink pouch as far as what it evokes. Sniff nuts. Are there any animals?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Animal Handling,"What was the name of the forest? Ooh, it hit that, does that count? Can I roll again? It still counts, yeah, unfortunately. Eight. You don't see anything specifically. You do hear birds, so it isn't bereft of wildlife. At least you get the sense that there is at least a symbiotic relationship with some wildlife in the bit of the forest you've been in. I'd love to take one of my goodberries to draw one of the birds and see if I might talk with it and see if it could tell us anything about before.",MATT: Make an animal handling check.
Persuasion,"The one that's sitting, stands up and puts his crossbow like-- ready, not pointing it at you, but-- Ja. We are good here. ""What is your intent here?"" We have been traveling a great distance. We are here to speak, if you don't mind, we have a message for Ophelia Mardun. It can only be heard by her. We have been charged with this message and no funny business. I hope that we could impart our message and be done. ""I can take your message and pass it on!"" Would you tell her that a very refined gentleman from the south would like to pass his regards to her.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"a motion over to the other guard who's finished eating, who's also pulled the shortbow off the shoulder and has knocked an arrow into it. Gives a whistle and the doors to the estate open, and you watch as three more guards emerge with crossbows, and one with a heavy crossbow at the ready. They all keep them at the ready, very close eye. One of them begins to patrol the outside of the building. You get the sense immediately that there's a general anxiety and tension at this space when strangers approach. They're being very careful. Can I look around, do I see anybody who's hidden, watching from windows up above, anything that looks like we're being watched?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"are the help that he sent. Timely, three days ""earlier would have been better, but here we are. I shall not fret on it. Thank you for coming. Be at ""ease, go watch the back walls, make sure nobody tries to sneak in while we're talking."" The guards all scatter, except for two who stay posted at each side of the door behind you. ""How much have ""you been told?"" (small laugh) Not very much. You watch as her eyes looks you from head to toe and her tongue runs across her lip a bit.

Did it look like she cast a spell just then?","MATT: Sure, make an insight check."
Persuasion,"""your name?"" Keg. ""Keg, I know that name."" I used to work for them. Not anymore. At which point you hear the guards behind (cocking crossbow). The crossbows go back up into position. You glance over your shoulder to see them both pointed-- ""What assurances can I have ""that I not need strike you down where you stand?"" You don't have any, but I have a lot of information about them. We just killed one of them. Oh, that's true. That's better. We killed one of them.",MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.
Perception,"back with the bright white teeth against the darkened skin. ""Do not disappoint me. I can be very frustrated when I'm disappointed."" Turns back and makes her way back up the steps. We're left with guards? Two guards, yes. All right, good fellows, would you escort us out and point us in the right direction? They wordlessly walk and lead you around through a dining chamber back to a small storage-- it'd be kitchen adjacent, though you don't see a kitchen yet. You can smell that musty scent of stored oats and grains, rice. Did I see any books on the way out?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Survival,"that vines have completely taken over. The vines themselves, a similar purple-grayish color as to the rest of the leaves. A lot of the foliage seems to fall into that same coloration. Not all of it, but a lot of it. It seems to cross multiple types of vegetation. As you're escorted from this room, the two guards give a nod, close it behind you. The old man goes and sits back, puts his bench up against the knotted base of a thick tree that's growing out of the ground where you had emerged from. Leans against it, grabs a jug and sits and looks at you. Can I tell where The Sour Nest would be from here?",MATT: Make a survival check.
Stealth,"One moment, it will take effect soon. Oh. End that way. Keep it down. Let's go. It does warm your belly, and that warmth spreads through your torso and it's-- whenever Jester has come and pulled you from the edge of death with a spell, it's a fragment of that warmth from the inside of your torso. 'Member? 'Member berries. 'Member Jester? 'Member clerics? Oh yeah, I 'member. Following Keg through the wood, I would like","you all to make stealth checks, please."
Stealth,"(whispering) There is a very large black bear ahead of us, with bones coming out of its butt and stuff and it has just laid down for a nap. (whispering) We have to be very quiet. (whispering) Can you do that thing again? That makes us all stealthy? (whispering) Yes, of course. (whispering) So we can all sneak by? (barely audible) I would like to cast Pass Without a Trace. (laughter) Okay. With that addition, everyone roll","another stealth check, since you are taking the"
Stealth,"(whispering) Yes, of course. (whispering) So we can all sneak by? (barely audible) I would like to cast Pass Without a Trace. (laughter) Okay. With that addition, everyone roll another stealth check, since you are taking the bonus there. What are we going to do? 23. Don't fuck me, Gil. Eh, fuck you, Gil. Is that with the plus ten? Without, so I'm at 33. But you do have heavy armor, so you do have","disadvantage on your stealth checks, I remember that."
Perception,"Okay, so, Frumpkin makes it up. Tree, waits a moment, tree. The one guard you see doing the perimeter notices. I tell him telepathically to just chill and sit there for a while. After a minute or so, the guard just keeps looking out. Jumpy. From Frumpkin's view, down inside, you can see the exterior of this. There is a large collection of brown wood kegs and a couple of small crates that contain materials that you're unaware of. You can see there are two entrances, one at the front and one at the back of the building. There are not windows, but small holes put into the wood and from the inside-- Actually,","roll a perception check for Frumpkin, thank you."
Perception,"Perception, you say? 22. 22. Looking through these curved window ports about that big, essentially large enough to look through and fire through, but small enough to not really allow a person to push through. You can see there's about two inches of stone, so it is a stone structure that has wood as a decorated exterior to it, so it's pretty solid. Down inside, you do see about six horses that are hitched on the back side of it and two carts and a third one that is currently being repaired. Those are our carts! How many people do I see down inside? There's one up top on the wall. You now see","with Frumpkin, thanks to that perception roll, a"
Perception,"over, and is going to take a shot. Take your shot. Natural five! It's going to put it at a nine. I'm pretty sure that doesn't hit. Does not hit my owl. (arrow hissing) ""Eh, shit,"" you hear muttered over the side. Seems bored and wanted to shoot at something that looked interesting. You hear beside you: Arschloch. There you are in the courtyard now. I want to go toward-- My terrible map of what I think based on what he drew. It's not bad. Immediately glancing around,","make a perception check, actually, as you are"
Stealth,"way up here. Boss shouldn't've been so careless with that, but I mean, I'm not going to tell him that. You know, it's frustrating."" The women finishes a bite and a big swig of her glass. ""Yeah, well, you got to break some eggs, sometimes."" Like she's making some big pontification, some big statement. He goes, ""Wise words,"" and keeps drinking and they go into a quiet state, but there's two of them now present. You do know that at least they've returned and there are some present inside. It does not appear that there's any other entrance downward. There's a secondary door on the opposite end. Go to the secondary door.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Perception,"so I go toward the trapdoor, see if I can't get in. Make a strength check in your mouse form. Try and squeeze under? This is when a natural 20 is-- aw. Nine, that's a nine. Yeah, no. I'll put that at a minus four. Your mouse isn't strong enough to budge the door that is currently-- There might be a hole in the floor or something else. I feel like that's the key, but I want to keep looking to see how many Iron Shepherds there may be in any other location that I haven't explored.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Perception,"cover everything and gather as much of the layout. We'll say as you move into one of the other rooms, the next two, you do notice that there are two other chambers. This upper floor is divided into three different chambers. There is the wide one that has the four beds, there's one that has two other beds, and there's one that has a singular large bed. This one room is almost like a master bedroom. You gather this is probably the room that Lorenzo sleeps in. It's a wider bed. It has, of all the other middling elements of comfort, this one comparatively is more extravagant, more comfortable. The layers of cushions-- A Dwendalian king.","MATT: Goddamn it, Sam. Make a perception check."
Stealth,"Do I know what kind of meat? There is a skull. A tiny skull. Oh boy. That's not good. An animal? Not animal. I'm almost about to squeak three times but I'm going to hold it together. I want to get out now. You make your way down off the side of the bed and into the hallway and begin to turn around towards the staircase down. As you begin to descend the staircase, you hear heavy footsteps making their way towards the base of the stairs. (thumping sounds) You hear the shifting of",leather. Make a stealth check... with the mouse's
Stealth,"looming up, towards the muscled form of a tired, but intent to peruse his domain, Lorenzo, making his way up the same staircase. No glaive in his hands. As you step up, you manage to wait for the right moment, hiding in the shadow of the step. As his legs cross over, you dart down to make your way, and he doesn't see a thing. You make your way back down into the main entryway to this, back out under the main entrance under the door. You are now in the courtyard. You head on over to the barrels. Yes! Squeak, squeak, squeak! Come get me! Frumpkin has kept watch, specifically sees the mouse return. Darts down and snatches you up",in your form and swoops up. Make a stealth check
Stealth,"Well, I like the idea of an extra hand or two to back us up, but I also agree with you. We go in at night and try to take the guards out, who are watching quietly, hopefully. If that is the case, we can go in and get our friends, and if we do that successfully, then we can burn these ones in their sleep. Again with the burning thing. Write what you know. So. Let's search around and see if we can search the woods. Do a perimeter check? Perimeter check. Looking for secret entrances!",MATT: All right. I will need both stealth checks
History,"a healer-- That would be amazing, though. I mean healing potions are nice, but we need someone who can-- we get killed a lot or nearly, you know? Yeah. I've seen some pretty badass priests in my day. Do I have any sense of-- You have? She mentioned some of the kooky ones out in the woods, right? Yeah, she mentioned a Blooming Grove. Do I have any sense of what that is? You've not necessarily heard of The Blooming","Grove. Roll a history check, actually."
Survival,"please? Oh, also are our horses dead? No, we can take the horses. It wouldn't speed us up, but at least we'd be on horses. You can take them with you. But it wouldn't speed us up, because it's the woods? Because it's like a thick wood. Let's walk. Okay. Who's up front? Who's in the back? Who's guiding what? Would I know better, potentially, where I'm going? Should I be in front? Or have I never been to this? It depends. Whoever wants to guide this will",be taking the survival checks to lead you through.
Survival,"Beau in the middle? Nott, do you want the middle? Yes, please. There you go. I'll put Frumpkin there, next to-- okay. Fuh-wumpkin. Taking this moment now, you begin to head back away from Shadycreek, and helming this group of ragtag adventures you've under your wing. You tread into an area of the Savalierwood you've not traveled before hoping that your instincts, your smell bag, and the spirit of what nature has managed to maintain itself through this corrupted wood could guide you properly to your destination.","I need you to make a survival check, please."
Perception,"begins to be not quite as biting cold, slightly warmer with each step. Looking around immediately, the first thing that catches your eye is this large wall of tangled vine and thorns. The same purplish-gray color. The green is still ahead of you. Do you guys want to continue on? Anything you want to do? You said there's a wall of thorns? It looks like a natural wall that curls up about five or so feet. In our way. In your way, yes. How far to the sides does it go? As far as the eye can see?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"placed long ago, that has since been slowly taken back by nature. You then begin to see that area of the wall that you had noticed, Nott, that had seemed to be bending, and the vines have actually curled over and bent it downward. It seems that whatever this little section of the forest is-- whatever protective magics that once contained this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the corruption of the Savalierwood. Should we hop the fence? One moment. I send Frumpkin up to flit about 50 feet ahead to see if there is anything ahead, or from a bird's eye view that we are unable to detect.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check for Frumpkin"
Investigation,"You mean the tapestry? The tapestry. I know it might hurt it, but if we drape it over-- We buried him with it. Oh, that's right. But that's a good idea. You want to go back? I could try to hack at it with my axe. Could an animal jump over it? Yeah. You guys could attempt to climb and leap over. Elements of it are thorned and jagged. This is what I used to do to hop fences back in the day. I look for a few broken-down branches that might be my height.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Nature,"over it, we can't go under it. Ten. That's fair. It takes you a few minutes and you find a couple of softer pieces of branch and vine that have fallen to the corruption. It's interesting  you touch them and they're supple like vines, but they're gray and freezing to the touch. It's a very weird, unnatural feeling, but it seems supple. Before I do anything with it, I take it over to Nila. Nila, have you seen any type of blight on a plant like this before? Do you know what this is? It's cold, feel it. You're right. Do I know what this is?",MATT: Make a nature check.

Do I know what this is? Make a nature check.",SUMALEE: I love making nature checks. Yes! 17.
Perception,"I take the branches and I try to lay them down over the vines a little bit and give a little less thorny of a ramp. You lean them up against it and slowly they bow over. Look, they hook all on their own, that's pretty good. Good job, Beau. Thank you, look at that! We could try to throw you. I guess it might make more sense to throw you, but I don't want to-- No, you can throw me, sure. Caleb starts to climb over.",MATT: All right. Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"As you carefully place your hands across the elements of vine and root, you manage to keep a keen glance for any sort of bladed, thorned, or hooked elements that protrude from the local fauna. You manage to avoid any of them from catching your coat, catching your flesh, and step, leaping over to the opposite side without issue. That's amazing! He's amazing. Nobody was aware I was panicked the whole time. The thorns are almost like small razors. I'm coming! Careful. I'm just going to dash over. You're just going to dash over? Make an",acrobatics check.
Investigation,"boundaries, eventually making your way into the central area of the Blooming Grove. The term now striking a bell as you look around and can see these beautiful flowers as the sun rays hit and pass. It's like the color flares up once the light hits it and then seems to gray as it passes on. You now stand, temperature much warmer, and there's just that stone structure ahead. How far away is the structure? From where you're standing on the interior of it, about 40 or so feet. On the tombstones that are around, do I recognize any of the language, or can I tell how old some of these gravesites are?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"So should I go knock on that door? Is there a door? There is a door, yes. Hold on. How big a place is the door place? The door itself is maybe four feet wide, it's a single door. It's an old wood-- the bottom half of it is green with growing moss and other bits of vegetation that are set in to the relatively damp wood that it's constructed from. The top seems to be split and warped a little bit over time due to the moisture in the air. Caleb tries to creep up to a gravestone and hide behind it to get within 30 feet of the door.","MATT: Okay, make a stealth check."

Okay, make a stealth check. On the roof or the top of the-- sorry. Nine. On the roof or top of the structure, are there any holes or anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"There are windows. You can only really see the front and right side of it, the southeast side of it from your perspective-- there is a single window. It is an arched window that looks like it may have been built at one point to hold glass or stained glass, but it is no longer there. You can see the soft, jungle-like flora at the base of it has swooped up and grown over and into the interior of the structure. Best you can tell from this distance, there is no visible light immediately inside, but there is a bit of natural light that is coming in through the open space. Can I go over to the window and take a peek in, stealthily?","MATT: Sure, roll a stealth check."
Insight,"(shouting) Do you know him? What's his name? I do not! But he's a firbolg! He is one of my people! (gasps) He is a firbolg. This will be good. My smell bag was right again! I'm going to come out, I'm going to have a little kettle set up on a little tripod. I'm putting it down, I'm putting a big rod with a big purple chunk of amethyst on it underneath the kettle. Tapping it a couple times to get the kettle to start heating up. I'm going to wander into the graveyard and find some flowers for tea. Okay. Can we tag along? Do you need any help? Does he seem like he's going to kill us?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Survival,"(laughter) May I helm it with Clay? Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. You can call me Clay. Caduceus. Deuces! Deuces Clay. It is decided. I have been trying not to show you this art for two weeks now. Caduceus, are you wanting to help? Or Nila, I think, is asking for your help in fording this forest, as you have a little more experience. Sure!",MATT: So make your survival check with advantage.
Stealth,"if we have to come back tomorrow night, we'll know what to expect. Are there more guards at night? We don't know, they could have six more dudes who come up there at night. Let's go. We're wasting time just talking. We'll just look. We'll go look. Okay, so you head straight to The Sour Nest? All right. Over the next couple of hours, you make your way, scooting as opposed to the more southern direction you were traveling, heading eastward. Carefully making your way on the outskirts of the northern side of North Clover of Shadycreek Run, I",need you all to make stealth checks.
Stealth,"Best that you can tell, he's not a ""leave no man behind"" type individual. Okay. He isn't? He is not. But he is a vengeful type of individual? He's definitely a fan of an eye for an eye. If it goes south, and we manage to kill one of them, he might chase us. True. Or maybe not. Or maybe not. It could be a backup. No, it's good. Let's go.","ASHLY: Oh, stealth checks, right."

Perception,"same voice go, ""Fucking hell! What-- Phil! I fucking shot an owl, it's still flying! I hate ""this forest! It's bullshit!"" You hear this voice a little further away go, ""(laughing) You suck!"" He's like, ""Shut up!"" Loads another bolt into it and starts-- You see now is actively looking for the owl to finish it off and regain his pride. I told him to go down low to the ground. Yeah. Can you bring him back? I kind of want that arrow. Ja, I can, but I poof into Frumpkin's senses. Do I hear anything besides Phil and Mystery Man?",MATT: Make a perception check with advantage.
Perception,"knock down the folks, someone on each party should put on their cloak and resume their guard pattern and keep walking around the wall. Very sneaky. That is an excellent idea. You can respond-- oh, you did. Yeah. You and I, we're good. We have this little routine. Beauregard can do that on this side. What about on your side? You? You're short. Keg. She's short. But not as short as Nott. You could stand on top of me. Are these guys humans, these guards?",MATT: Make a perception check. (yawns) Pardon me.
Stealth,"No! Are they in place? We're going. She's on my shoulders. I'm on her shoulders, I'm up against this fucking wall! You're doing this, I'm going to try and (grunt)-- Then we're shooting at the same time? We're shooting at the same time. I'm going to hold Hold Person until these two are right under the guard. I want to wait until right after he passes, and then I want to do some ninja stuff. Are you just sipping tea? Yep.","MATT: First, I need you to make a stealth check"
Stealth,"Then we're shooting at the same time? We're shooting at the same time. I'm going to hold Hold Person until these two are right under the guard. I want to wait until right after he passes, and then I want to do some ninja stuff. Are you just sipping tea? Yep. First, I need you to make a stealth check because you're having to move right up against the wall. This is a ten-foot clearing. I do. Use the dodeca if you need to. That's true.",MATT: Both of you guys roll stealth checks.

Both of you guys roll stealth checks. Mmm. Doesn't she get a plus ten to the stealth?",MATT: It is a plus ten to stealth check.
Perception,"quietly, keeping an eye out. Ooh, nice. Would you mind giving me another boost real quick? Not a problem at all. Between your acrobatics and your ability, your height, without an issue, you get to the top. You guys now are on top of the wall, cloaked. Where do you want to go? I look over at Deuce and give a nod. You said that out of game and I can't say anything about it. I send Frumpkin up into the air to do a circle around the entire perimeter.",MATT: Perception check with advantage please.
Investigation,"Mr. Clay! Cool trick! Finishing your Detect Magic, you do not detect anything magical of the outer gate. It is locked. Are we going in together? Should we do back entrance/front entrance? I can unlock the front entrance for you guys. I take my wire and I say: Nott are you on the ground still? Can you meet me at the front gates quietly? Yeah, give us a minute. I am going to rifle through the dude's pockets and go through the guy we just killed's stuff.","MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check, because"
Stealth,"If you want to. Make an investigation check. 17, what do I add? Investigation. Minus one. 16. 16, okay. You find 22 gold pieces. Added to my ten, that seems like a lot. And a pack of crossbow bolts, 16 crossbow bolts. Totally useful. Waiting very anxiously for my life partner. Oh! Yes, let's go! Oh, not you. You stay up there. Let's go, but be stealthy.",MATT: I'd like you both to roll stealth check with
Stealth,"Wait, with advantage? Disadvantage for her because of her armor. Oh, son of a fuck, come on Ash. Okay. Don't go lower than that, that's got to be the worst. That was the worst. Still not great. This is the worst? No. Seven plus-- Seven plus five. Okay, 12, good to know. I say: Meet at the front gate. Okay.",MATT: You're going stealth as well? Roll a stealth
Perception,"Trace on. You do, so that's plus ten. Oh, thank goodness. Thank you. Lasts for like ten minutes, I think. 14 Lasts for an hour? Up to an hour. Okay, so this is four plus ten. Okay. Eventually, the four of you meet towards the front gate, seemingly, from what you can tell, no one's noticed. From my vantage point, I'm going to see if there's anybody in the courtyard, or if there's anything-- since I'm up there now.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Hey, look at the windows, too. They're nice. Oh no! I'm looking in the windows. Okay, you see nobody else inside the courtyard. You occasionally see the flickering movement. It looks like firelight is the source of light that's coming through the two windows on the two sides of the facility you can see. No movement yet. Okay, I'm going to slowly start pacing around towards the front. I'm also going to look into the windows. Do I see anything from my vantage point?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"30 feet, it's like a field and you can say yea or nay. That's my view. It doesn't say at the moment of casting you have to select  just that for the duration you choose. So, my interpretation, I would allow someone to step into the radius, and you could then choose. Okay, so we know better. We know you don't have to cast it. I'll snuggle up to Nila. I choose Keg. Let's tippy-toe around the back door. Okay, let's go! All right, everyone who's now making their","way around the back, make another stealth check."
Deception,"you had previously made your way in and out via owl the previous day. As you guys scoot past, you hear the front door of the facility (thudding) (creaking). It opens ever so faintly to the inside, and a figure peers out, having apparently heard something. We don't see that? No, we already went-- No, these two. We asked them if they saw anything right before we went. I didn't see that. You see a figure poke the head out and look curiously. Sorry!","MATT: ""What?"" Make a deception check, with"
Stealth,"see a dining area of some kind, and you see there are two of the hired guards in the process of finishing an evening drink. Was it Phil and the other guy? Is it Phil? One of them is Phil. One of them is the other guy. Looks like they're having a nightcap. Are they drunk? They've been drinking. You have no idea if they're drunk. Frumpkin sees the two of them hushedly chatting to one other and drinking from tankards. I will have Frumpkin back away, under the crack.",MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check for Frumpkin
Perception,"But he disappears in the back of the door. They both look around like, ""Shit. Ugh. I can't sleep now with that thing around here. Keep ""looking."" That's the last thing that Frumpkin hears before vanishing. Oh boy. That was wild. Okay. Yes. Oh, hi. Again. There's two of them. I pull a wire out and I aim towards my friends on the horses. There's two of them. Six seconds go by. There's two of them on the first floor. What do we do? What do we do now? Should we go in? Do we have any sense if their clanging disturbed anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"will see what is going on. If the trapdoor is open? If it's unlocked. Oh, if it's unlocked. Okay, got it. Do not go in yourself right away, send in Frumpkin to look. I will be watching the whole time. All right. Are you drinking to the point of intoxication? No, just one big swig. All righty. Okay, let's go. All right. Got to pick a lock first, or check the door.",MATT: Make an investigation check on the door.
Stealth,"go to shit. To the right is a hallway, an open entrance that goes into a pantry or storage room. To the left is a door that leads beyond the kitchen. Tickle means right  left is nothing. Is there a tickle? No. I will go straight. You're at a door. I will try the door. It opens, it's not locked. Tickle, tickle. You feel a tickle. I turn right.","MATT: Make a stealth check, please, because you're"
Acrobatics,"You can move (counting). You can't quite get between the two of them, but you can be wedged into the doorway. If they try to move away from you, you will get an attack of opportunity if you want to take one as a reaction. Okay. That ends your turn. Back at the top. Beau, you're up. Okay. Have I heard my cherry bomb go off? Not quite yet, because it's on an initiative of 20. Oh, what? Amazing. Okay. I'm going to move my full speed, my 40 feet. Does it get me in?",MATT: Make an acrobatics check to leap off the
Acrobatics,"going to keep running. Another 30 feet. Which direction? Around here? Yeah. Well, because I'm still trying to get where the spider told me to go. (counting) There you go. As Nott comes around the corner, I'm just Hey! Psst! Huh? Ah! (shushing) That finishes Nott's go. Clay, you're up. Another 60 feet. Are you jumping off the wall or going full square on the outer wall? I'll jump off the wall.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and land.
Perception,"you grab it, lift it up, put it onto a shoulder. Using the cable, you pull it back until you find a piece of rock off to the side and hook it to it to where it maintains the tautness. You find another metal ring that is designed specifically to hold the trap when it's not set. It does not go off. The trapdoor opens, and there is a staircase that descends to a lower floor. See? Just easy as that. Is it open? It's open. Let's go in. Open it. No. I hold up Frumpkin, I place him on the edge of the trapdoor, and send him scrambling under to look.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for Frumpkin.
Stealth,"leads to a chamber beyond, and that's where you hear the whimpering coming from. What I don't like about this is that the asshole was sleeping upstairs and we don't know about that at all, but I send Frumpkin along the ceiling and through-- that looks like a barred gate. As Frumpkin looks within, you can see another chamber. You can see another hired figure, at least the same cloaked individuals you had encountered before, same attire, who is currently sitting at the back, up against the wall, and is looking in the direction of the door expectantly. I will attempt to send Frumpkin over his head along the ceiling stealthily.",MATT: Make a stealth check for Frumpkin. Frumpkin

Yasha and Jester, I'm going to keep going and you said roll--",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Deception,"stairwell at the front of the building. Okay. I'm going to go down with Clay, but just at the stairs, since I also look like a guard. Okay. So you stay at the stairs there, Beau. Yep. All right. As you glance through, Clay, you can see the faint light in here, you can see the figure's walking up to the cage, eyes still trained on the door. I'm just tapping on the doors. All clear. We got one, it's Keg. We'll handle it. I'm going to head back upstairs.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Deception,"18. 18? I'm going to start heading back up. ""All right, I'll get back to work."" We could use your help up here if you got a second. ""I'm going to finish up."" As you turn around and begin to ascend the stairs, you begin to hear what sounds like a child beginning to scream. (screams) I tap on the bars with my staff, and I Wait man, Phil, there's something wrong with Phil, I think he really needs our help. Fucking Phil, am I right?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Investigation,"corner. You guys manage to step off to the side and pull yourself out of the rubble, but you get the sense now that this room is definitely trapped and there is definitely an awareness within and deeper of your presence. Nila, as you recover from this, you glance up and see the cage in the corner that you had passed when you first entered and you see a hand hanging off one of the metal bars-- a a bit of fur that covers and vanishing into the faint, grayish-blue tint of what is Asar's hand. I want to go to him, to touch him-- but I want to make sure that there's nothing that is going to trigger something else.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"(laughter) You bent it! You can't blame the mother! Roll for Healing Word. Just for my own giggles, I'm going to cast Detect Magic really quickly, because this place is giving me the creeps. Okay. I have an auto-thing I can do apparently, which is nuts. I'm going to need a new iPad. This thing is crashing and falling apart the whole night. Great job. I'm going to look around for keys or something. Just around the room.",MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"done that. [laughter] Oh, but I can't hear you. Looking through Frumpkin's eyes, there's no time to waste. I've Hasted her to protect me since it's just the two of us, but I have to move upstairs. So I'm going to feel my way up the stairs and hope that Keg comes along. Caleb begins to slowly climb up the stairs, feeling out along these spirals as it carries from the bottom floor to the upper tier of The Sour Nest fortress. While I ask Frumpkin to continue along the right path.",ASHLY: Do I need to make a stealth check?
Perception,"As Frumpkin enters the final room, it reveals a large bedchamber adorned with more intricate silks and accoutrement, to design a garish but somewhat ghastly bedroom in dark reds and purples. You can see, on the side of the bed, a plate that still contains mostly eaten remains of some sort of creature. The room smells of a musty smoke and some thick animalistic musk. It's hard to pinpoint, but it's a putrid stench immediately once it hits Frumpkin's nose. But the room is empty. Okay. Quickly, do I see anything of note in this room?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"No, we got an-- you really not following? I felt like that was really clear. Just stay here in case-- when Caleb and Keg get back. You're going to go attack these people with--? I'm going to see if I can get them to leave the house and if they don't leave the house, then I think you should probably shoot them with that thing. We're going to have them chase the escaped prisoners. All right. Sounds good. As this is transpiring, what did you roll",for a perception check?
Stealth,"arrival of footsteps rushing along the stone on the outside of the small hallway that leads to the trapdoor into the basement. What do you do? I'm going to position myself in the corner between that-- hunch against the wall, try and lose my breath if that makes sense. I'm going to face away since I don't have the disguise spell and look really perturbed towards the prison. Matt, are they in the little hall just outside the-- Yeah, it's maybe a 15-foot wide hallway. Can I sneak into the far hallway that is away from the kitchen?","MATT: Yeah, you can do that. Make a stealth check,"
Deception,"Her you mean? Her, oh thank you. Mr. Clay, I am a woman, I know you're new here. (laughter) There's a whole conversation there that I'm excited to have when we're not having, okay-- We need one for questioning man. We caught one of them. Let me go! I didn't do nothing wrong. Nope, no, we got you. I say shut up you miscreant and I backhand Nott. (cries out)",MATT: All right. I'll say make a deception check
Perception,"Oh, that was great. We still got two downstairs. A strange blur streaks by. Caduceus, you see it from the upstairs. It looks like a blur of black. No larger than that big. It scoots past and curves around the corner, back in the direction of the basement. Did somebody see something? What the fuck? I'm going to-- I don't know why I'm being quiet. We should head downstairs. You guys see this and begin to follow past. Beauregard, you're still standing back by the hatch and something stops in front. Make a",perception check.
Stealth,"(stuttering) Just this once, I think I should go first. (gasps) You don't need to do this, Caleb, if you don't want to. I'm not there anymore. So brave! [cheering] Brave. Dead. It's semantics, really. Caleb, as you continue down the hall, unveiling it to the right, it still appears to be open without issue. You peek further down. The rest of you follow suit or do you stay in the back chamber? I feel like I should hang back, probably. stealth-wise. I'm going to go up and peek around.","MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

Perception,"What's happening up there? The audience is aroused! (laughter) You hear as Ruzza looks over to Protto and goes, ""Are they coming or not? I'm getting ""impatient."" Protto goes, ""Yeah, maybe we should poke one of them."" He pulls out a blade and jams it into the cage to the left. You hear a voice against the gag. A muffled yell. I am going to move into the room and sit down on the floor between the cage and the door, pressed against the wall. Right here? Ja and just wait.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"contact lenses. You immediately recognize the familiar scent of Caleb's coat right in front of you. Oh! Caleb! Caleb, is that you? Act natural. [laughter] All right. Caleb, it's your turn. I'm going to slide out away from Nott and go to the other side, clear of the hallway, to look into the cage that's there. Into the cage across-- To the other side of the room. Is anyone alive or dead in that cage?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"slightly, but not enough. You do feel, however, that whatever weight is carrying it down, it's heavy, but with two people you might have a chance of lifting it. But it looks like the bars are too thick to try and pull apart. I did the wrong-- We should-- Under's better. That's okay. With our legs... lower back, you know. Yeah. That ends Keg's turn. Caduceus. I want to search this little hallway for a switch or some kind of panel to open this thing from this side.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"way down the edge and around the corner, vanishing into this next chamber. Oh god, I'm knocking things over. It happens, I'm sorry. It's fine. They'll be okay in the end. There we go. Ending your view there, what are you going to do? Marisha, did you just look at me? Is that what's happened? That's why you're suddenly laughing? (laughing) Yeah, fuck you. Sorry. Let's see. Oh, you know what? Is there a mechanism for opening that gate? You can spend the rest of your turn investigating the room for something like that, if you'd like. Yeah, why don't we do that?",MATT: Roll an investigation check.
Investigation,"inside, gagged and bound, chains, manacles behind the back, and similar to the other captives being held. There is a doorway that one of the higher guards is closing behind him, and for a brief glimpse, you see Protto and Ruzza further in the chamber with a torch light source within the next room before the door closes. If I am able to now, I will send Frumpkin over the ceiling and down the door, and if there is a crack, he will go through. Are the rest of you moving in further to the next chamber? Sure, yeah, if there's no threat. I'll scan for traps as I walk.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Stealth,"What you do is the Mage Hand runs itself around the outskirts of it, pulling up the dust and dirt that has settled in to have it blend in with the rest of the stone, curling beneath, and pops it up, and causes it to fold up a bit, lift out the stone tablet, and drift it off to the side and set it down. The trap is still armed, but that part of the floor has now been moved out of the way. So we can step over, around it? Yes! Wow! Caleb! Are you right next to me? No. No. You're sending Frumpkin into the next chamber? Ja. If there's a gap, ja.",MATT: There is a slight gap. Roll a stealth check
Intimidation,"they capture, it's minimal sustenance and a lot of mental and psychological damage, as well as physical torture to go along with it. You've seen and endured some of it, but looks like some of these other figures have gone through more of it. I have one goodberry left over from Nila that she gave me that I didn't eat. So I'm going to hand him the goodberry-- Well, his hands are bound. I'm going to feed him the goodberry. He looks at you with his one semi-good eye, and, ""What-- What are-- What are you-- Why?"" What, you don't like berries? (shouting) Just eat the berry!",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Arcana,"sort-of-gradient-colored half-orc, and maybe an amazing-looking white and sort-of, kind-of-black, dark angel thing? He looks to you, first kind of still taken aback by the goblin face, and the sharpened teeth, and the yellow eyes staring back. But he calms himself. ""Uh, I think those were the new projects ""he took below."" Projects? I don't like that-- We've got to move. Caleb is already in the next room, steering clear of the trap and trying to inspect if that brazier is arcane in nature, or if there is anything dangerous other than the trap.",MATT: Make an arcana check.
Nature,"You take ten points of fire damage as it just incinerates past you. And you take a step back, and the flame is now super small. Like it just expended a lot of its fire energy. In the brazier it's just this low flicker. And it begins to burn brighter again-- Aah! While it's going, I'm going to see if I can yank open the thing! All right, go ahead and make a strength check. (whining) Can I do athletics? [laughter] This is a straight strength check unfortunately, sorry.","SAM: Um, I'd prefer a nature check?"
Stealth,"That's cool. Couple of tanks up in here. The Duchess heads down into the chamber, and it opens into a T-shaped chamber facing your direction. The stairs here descend down into this area. The room is low-lit with a red glow emanating from two furnaces, one on each side there with faint red embers and bits of ash that flicker out with small bits of flame. Now I don't want my baby to go too far, okay? Just let her see what's-- Hovering right there? I'd say yeah. Just enough to stay in the shadow.","MATT: All right, make a stealth check for your"
Performance,"puppet it a little bit. Ooh! With coconuts you can make it sound like horses! I don't have a coconut. I-- I think we're mixing. I think the streams are crossing. So yeah, I'm going to give it a little bit of sound. It worked super well right? You got two husks and you're smacking them together. I'm clanging down. You're making the clanging sound. Illusion Keg is clanging down.",MATT: Make a performance check.
Perception,"They see it. There's somebody watching. It's a person firing. Yes it's someone-- It's Protto. Where are those shots coming from? From under the table, and also from somewhere else. Maybe it's Protto and that lackey. Well we know that Protto shoots arrows, right? And then someone else could be the other one. And then they had that hired hand with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's them. Would we be able to see anything to make",perception checks from here?
Perception,"Right. All right, so your vision, with the Duchess you can see beyond that but you do not have-- A full-- The ability to actually hit something unless you move down below. Just a heads-up. Right. All right. Caduceus? I think i'm going to-- Oh god-- We don't want all the magic in one place. That seems like a bad idea.

Okay, very good, and here we go. That'll be ten points of damage. Nice. Take that, Wu Tang Clan. Did that athletics jump count as an action, I'm assuming? Hmm?",ASHLY: Was the athletics check an action?
Perception,"pack that Faerie Fire, man. Aw. Who knew? I was drinking tea last time I got to pick spells. Faerie Fire is one of the best fucking spells, man! I'm curious about these rooms back here, those grates that you've still got covered over. What's over there? I don't know, do you want to go see? Yeah, I want to run over there-- Wait, you're looting?! I'm going to run over there. That's your movement can get you that close.",You can use your action to make a perception check

I'm going to use my action to--",MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
Perception,"All right, finishing Caduceus's turn. Shakäste, you're up. All right, I guess Shakäste and the Duchess will move into the chamber and check the other side of this chamber now that it's-- Whereabouts do you want to go? As far to the other side of this penis as we can get, yeah. That's about as far as you can get with your movement. Have the Duchess follow me as well. Go ahead and go to the end of the chamber there-- Right over here? Yeah, and perch there. Can she see inside?",MATT: Make a perception check for the Duchess with

Perception,"Absolved of all dam-- no. I don't know where anything is or what's going on and I feel real bad, so I'm going to try to crawl up the steps a bit, through the blood in my face. Ja, I'll crawl up the steps and then, hey, I will just throw a Fire Bolt where he was. That probably won't work, but let's do it. Roll for an attack with disadvantage. Ja. Natural 20.

Keg is going through the corpses of the different thugs and rolling them for change. She's got a cigarette hanging out of the mouth feeling through pockets. Who's helming the investigation of the stronghold? I'll take one. I will assist. All right, so go ahead and roll twice and roll with advantage. What was that thing where I could spend a",ki point and do another roll on my insight check?
Investigation,"law. But it may have some use, you don't know. Blackmail! You did get the baseline 15 DC, though, in going through the upstairs chamber that you found to be Lorenzo's chamber. Through the bed, you find 15 gold pieces scattered in some of the shelves near the bed unit, beneath where there's the platter containing the remains of some young creature. Then beneath, tucked underneath the bed and up into the slats, you find a heavy leather bag of some kind. You pull it out, and what you find is-- Nothing's trapped, right? You can check if you want to. Go ahead and",make an investigation check.
Investigation,"A special coin? What does the coin look like? That's what it looks like. Oh, fuck! Physical props! In fact, you recognize it immediately. This is called a galley. This is a galley. A galley is specifically a gold piece that is produced along the Menagerie Coast. Ooh, it even smells good. It smells like home! Maybe we should open it. Is it trapped? I will look at the coin for traps!",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"And then I close the book. I go back inside after a little bit. Okay. You all finish a very necessary long night's rest. Coming to consciousness as the dome vanishes, exposing the center of the base floor walkway, where Caleb had set up both the protections of his spells and the dome in the first place.

You know the one who wields that weapon? ""I know of the one that did, yes."" This one broke his jaw almost off of his face, and then his skull was burned to ash.

Stealth,"they can hear you or not, but you see two rather extravagant-looking carriages making their way towards you. You can see this dark wood with gold detailing on the outsides. Each has a curtained window on the right and the left, sets of large, spoked wheels on each side, and each one has two horses affixed to the front. There is a driver at the front of each one. Nott, moon them. Moon them right now. Yes. I will moon them. There is no reaction, but you are, indeed, mooning them. (laughs loudly) I mean, we laugh very quietly, just in case.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Investigation,"I can say, if you'd like to, there are ways to transition the money. For ease, you can say gold piece value for keeping tabs on it, but you can say that a portion of it is platinum for ease of travel. Though you have a bag of holding  it's not a huge issue. Okay. Bag of holding is one of those items where eventually, when you reach a certain level, you're like, ""You know what? Let's not worry about all that copper and silver and gold piece weight with you.""

Deception,"quickly cast Eyes of the Grave. Are there any undead within 60 feet? Interesting point. No. No undead within 60 feet. Thank you. You feel a little more comfortable knowing that. Just wanted to check. Cree turns to you and goes, ""I hate to bother, but-- I'm happy to see you return. I see ""that Lucien is not with you."" Oh. Yes. That is correct.

The captain approaches, and herself leans in and pulls back. ""You are not incorrect, you carry nothing on your carts. This is a curious nature of an enchantment, indeed. And you said you're heading to Nicodranas and Port Damali to acquire goods. What are you looking to acquire?"" Some simple fabrics, meats. My friends haven't sampled the cuisine down there, and I was hoping to show them a bit of the Menagerie Coast.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"thorough that time."" Oh, I figure we're not difficult faces to remember. ""All right. Stay safe."" You too. ""The boundaries-- who knows what's wandering from the dark side of Xhorhas there? Eyes on your backs. Go!"" And the crownsguard pull away, and the ones on the opposite end open the space for you guys to move your cart along. With that, you pass through the gates of the Wuyun Gorge. Do the gates look any different since the last time we were there? Scratch marks? More wear and tear?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"frustration. Some of them are currently very vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are holding them to wait their turn. You keep your heads down and continue forward. There, you start heading into this large mountain pass. Extremely steep at certain points, where the mountains seem to be have been carved down or bisected by some ancient cataclysm, whether it be the Calamity or some great natural disaster long before that. It seems to be a very unique, singular cleft down in the center of these two mountains that breaks the mountain range between the Cyrios and the Ashkeeper. Who's keeping-- you're at the front of this? Mm-hmm.","MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for me,"
Animal Handling,"This is like old animation where it just repeats and repeats and repeats. Kind of, yeah. So, as you guys continue pressing forward on this path-- Oh no! The rocks destroy you! There's a rock slide, you guys. The Ettins are throwing boulders at us. Go, go, go! Caduceus, that was amazing! We'd better run. And Caleb, even better. So the horses, moving forward, at a-- I tell the horses, we're going fast.","MATT: All right, so make an animal handling check,"
Athletics,"one side and its hand reaches up to try and grab the face and it's just all sorts of discombobulated. So continue your round. You have advantage on your attacks now. I am now going to-- Don't forget to roll your extra d4 for damage, because you're big. Oh, that's right. Thanks, Caleb. Extra one point. Nine, better than eight. All right. In most countries. I am now going to attempt to, with that knee, give a full front kick and try and knock him prone. Okay.","MARISH: That's an athletics check, right?"
Athletics,"I am now going to-- Don't forget to roll your extra d4 for damage, because you're big. Oh, that's right. Thanks, Caleb. Extra one point. Nine, better than eight. All right.

Yes, so you're using an action to try and shove? Yeah, because I have advantage on",athletics checks.
Stealth,"that thing? This guy's going to be trashed. Oh no! All right, I'll-- He's big enough to still be in the battlefield. Okay, well then, I'm going to run up to the dead body and hide behind it. Or in it. There's not a corpse to hide into, but there's a wound that you can-- Then I'll hold my action until the other one starts moving towards us. Okay, gotcha. That ends Nott's turn. Beau, you're up. And bonus action hide back there.",MATT: Roll a stealth check.
Investigation,"parts of its dead form, and within bits of the wounds that you guys had left in it from your various hacks and attacks against its body, you see bits of reddish fungus begin to pop out and fill the various wounds. Nothing too intense, it begins the process. I'm going to take a handful and give it a smell. (sniff) Mmm. Look at that, he's useful now. That's good  that's so good. Blood fungus! Ah! I'm going to go get back on the cart. Is there anything on the giant's body? Worthy of stealing?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"From here. Jesus, we're going halfway across the world! You're traveling a long way, man. How long did it take for Caleb to come out of that? It took about a minute. A minute. I should probably stop doing that. (straining) Ugh. Can I set you down now? Okay. I'm going to set you down now. Okay. Let's go catch the cart. You guys rush up and hop into the cart, continuing your journey. For this next day or so,","Caduceus, make a perception check for me, please."
Perception,"try to match the gray. Just something I add to my routine. Easy enough. As you guys come to and wake up, off the side of the main path, you glance over to the right, and you can see, from the sound of hoof prints, two carts, 30 or 40 feet off the side, heading up the road. At the front, you see a-- I wouldn't say cloaked, but hooded man with a head wrap that falls into a scarf over one shoulder, a long, gray-and-gold set of comfortable travel robes sat at the front, who's looking over in your direction. In the back of the cart, you see numerous sizes of metallic cages of some kind. Are there people in them?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Nature,"(laughter) I don't know. I don't, either. We could get them and just figure it out as we go. We could figure it out. We'll have pets. You're going to lose that puppy. It's going to blink itself off a cliff and you're never going to be the same. You're going to be devastated. No, that blink dog is cool! Just watch it die. You guys all right? Is this all on the level? I'm just going to check with the animals that everything is copacetic.","MATT: Yeah, make a nature check."
Animal Handling,"dope glove? No, he didn't give you the glove. He didn't give me the glove? I just have him? You could take it, though. But I've got my wraps. Yeah. Well, you have your bracers. I have awesome bracers. He's talon into forearm, let's just be honest. Does it look cool on my bracers? He looks as pissed as you look all the time. Yeah, right? Yeah? Can I pet?",MATT: Make an animal handling check.
Stealth,"You should have it, and just keep him on your shoulder all the time. Yeah, I can train him to fly and come back to me, and be cool. Now Beau, you know a pet is a lot of responsibility. (laughter) I'm so glad that this is happening. I just want you to understand, you're going to have to feed it, take care of it, clean up after it. I know, Fjord! And I take out a little metal wire, and I add to this conversation and say, you are",responsible for this animal's stealth checks.
Animal Handling,"Mice, yeah. Cool. Don't let Nott find that. The other one is filled with what looks to be bits of dried jerky and dried fruit. Is that for the dog or— For the dog and/or the weasel, based on what you want to do. The cart continues northward and is out of your periphery. Are you double guns weasel and dog? I've got the weasel up here and the dog right here. What's his name? Poof? Nugget? Nugget. And we are home. Always blink to us.",MATT: Make an animal handling check on the blink
Insight,"weren't even near the ocean. That feels like the ocean's real dangerous to me. That could be a pituitary thing. I have never seen a sea creature in my life. There's so many. I saw a giant tentacle come out of the water one time. Right on the coast, you saw that? Yeah. A tentacle came out of the water? I saw it from my window. It was a really, really, really big tentacle. Did you really? Of course I did. Do I believe her?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Investigation,"time. As close as maybe 150 feet out, you see a small fishing ship that is on the outskirts of the southern portion of the city. Glancing off to the right to where the city docks begin, you can see dozens of ships that are in the middle of the harbor, that are coming into the harbor, many that are in the process of being anchored and then set up within the docks themselves. This eastern side you recognize as the Restless Wharf of the city and you know the harbor is broken into two different sides. I'm going to take a moment to look through the sand and rocks and see if there's anything interesting.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"Okay, yeah. There's the-- Do you know how to swim, Beau? Yeah. The rocks are pretty disparate amongst the shore here. There is one section where you can see a string of four rocks at different heights that eventually get to about 30 or so feet out into the shore before they disappear beneath the ocean surface. So before you even touch the water you dive on up to one of the rocks, and as you get to the top your hands hit there and you can already see the top of the rock is bleached white with seagull shit. But it's dry. Glancing over the side, you make a leap to the next one. Make an",athletics check.
Acrobatics,"Ooh, not good. Dexterity check? 11. 11. It rolled exactly an 11 on its dexterity, so you manage to just capture it. It's going to attempt to snipe at you. That's a 17 to hit with the armor class. It hits! Your thumb clamps down and there's an immediate flash of pain through your body. He's bleeding so much! There's so much blood! As you're trying to shake it off, it's still whipping back and forth, holding on tightly. I'm going to go down on it with my knee. Jump up and knee down on it.",MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.
Animal Handling,"animals are. Sprinkle is here. That's the weasel? Yes. Like on a doughnut. We did some training on the road. Yeah. I want to play fetch with Nugget, here at the beach. if you guys are doing some training, what are you training him in? I want to train Nugget to blink back to us. On a command? It's going to take you a couple hours of working with him here on the beach, but you can do",that. Make an animal handling check.
Animal Handling,"a professor or more like a Thaddeus and then I realized-- Why not a both? Exactly. Do you meditate for the full two hours that she's training the blink dog, or do you return to Professor Thaddeus in the cart? No, Beau could not meditate for two hours. No. I meditate for ten minutes, tops. Then I go back and-- I want to train Professor Thaddeus to come when I look regal and hold out my arm. Okay, so you stand about 50 yards from the cart and hold aloft your forearm, and attempt to find a way to coax Professor Thaddeus. Professor!",MATT: Roll an animal handling check.
Persuasion,"""Halt! What is your business in Nicodranas?"" We came to see the Ruby of the Sea perform tonight, ha! The one at the front, you can see beneath his helmet, which has these two bits of chainmail that curl open like curtains on each side of his face. He pulls them out of the way and looks forward towards the rest of the crew there. You can see his darker skin and his thick brow, it's almost like a unibrow that sits over sun-dried lips that are a bit cracked and parched. He glances forward, looks over the rest of you and goes, ""The Ruby of the Sea?"" Yeah!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Deception,"lips that are a bit cracked and parched. He glances forward, looks over the rest of you and goes, ""The Ruby of the Sea?"" Yeah! Make a persuasion check. I'll use the red dice for the Ruby. 15? 15? Okay. He goes, ""All right, and where do you hail from?"" We hail from Port Damali. Port Damali is from the other side, but it's fine. He goes, ""All right. It's roundabout. And ""you are?"" I am Fiona Fancypants! Theater critic extraordinaire!",MATT: Now make a deception check.
Perception,"lower part of the continent? Yeah, along the Menagerie Coast, Port Damali is the westernmost port city, which is why it's the largest here. It's the major hub of trade between all the western bits of civilization-- Tal'Dorei, Marquet, Issylra-- with the port town Nicodranas being the furthest east. The two of those mark the two endpoints, the bookends of the Menagerie Coast. There are a few other port towns in between, but they're smaller by comparison, and Nicodranas is about half the size of Port Damali. Right. As we're walking through to make it to Jester's mom's place, any familiar faces catching eyes?",MATT: Make a perception check.
History,"A lot of money has gone into its construction, and the closer you get to it, you can see that maybe it's not in the best of upkeep. But what you do notice is that the presence of Zolezzo is very strong. There's probably about 20 or more zolezzo that are in the process of keeping an eye on the vicinity, walking around the boundaries of the exterior of the Demesne. You can see eight or so that are stationed at the front, and a few that are walking along the upper parapets or high walls, keeping an eye down on the street. Does it seem like the same amount that's always been there? Yeah. It can vary, but you get the sense--","Make a history check, actually."
Investigation,"(laughter) Had some better days in the '80s. All right, Steven. So you-- Russian accent. Vague. My name is Sheagal. Okay. (Sean Connery voice) Steven Seagal. You cannot mix those two impressions together. It's too dangerous. (Sean Connery voice) I suddennly remembered my Charlemagne. (normal voice) Doesn't work. Doesn't work. The two of you make your way back to the Restless Wharf. You're searching for the Wharfmaster, specifically? Make an",investigation check.
Deception,"whispering. The dwarf puts his hand up for a second and finishes making a couple measurements and then, ""Huh. All right."" He jumps off his small stool and comes over with heavy footsteps across the wooden, creaking floor now extending over the wharf. He approaches the edge of the counter across from you and goes, ""Right, so you've summoned me to you. What can I do to help you?"" I'm sorry, we're quite new in town, unfortunately, my companion and I. We are from Port Damali, where we are trying to put down our business roots here. I'm sorry, does Vandren and his crew, do they make shipments here regularly? It's one of my return clients.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Persuasion,"sheets of paper and pulls it out for a second and looks at it. ""We currently have eight dock spaces not spoken for that are available for rent, if ""that is your interest. Depending on the size of the vessel, of course."" Seems like a lot of dock spaces. Have a lot of openings? Business been slow? ""No, we've just had a lot of ships leave recently. There is a lot of movement in and out."" Oh sure. Just curious. One other thing, we heard a gentleman over at the bar speaking, and someone called out to him, ""Marius LePual."" Does that ring-- how do you say that name?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"(knocking louder) The louder one seems to echo a bit, and after another minute or so of waiting, you hear this faint creaking sound. It's haunted! It's a robot. It gets louder and louder until eventually, the small door opens and you see this really shriveled woman's face. These beady, little, dark eyes peeking through and goes, ""Can I help you?"" Are you Gladys? ""I am."" I think we're supposed to talk. My name's Caduceus. Mother sent me.",MATT: Make a persuasion check. With advantage.
Persuasion,"there's actually a spyglass leaning against the edge She goes, ""I see a lot ""that goes on in this city."" Do you perhaps see the thing beneath the city? ""No. But I know there are things beneath it."" I fear that he may be in contact with something inappropriate. Do you see where he goes? ""There are a couple of places, I believe."" Do you know where he lives? ""I do not know where he lives."" Can I look through your spyglass please? Wait, tell us where--",MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Stealth,"Yeah, above you. That was a long walk, though. This is an awkward goodbye. You're not ganking that telescope. I'm not trying to gank the telescope. She's trying to get in the boob. Maybe I am. What are you trying to do? Well, I wanted to-- before she started ushering us out-- to Invoke Duplicity. And make it look like I was in front her but really stay behind. Oh boy. This is going to end poorly.",MATT: Make a stealth check.
Investigation,"wide surrounding it. No buildings are buttressed against it. It seems to be solitary amongst the rest of the constructed buildings here. Like people deliberately trying to stay away from it? The folks that are walking in the streets nearby tend to walk on the opposite side of the road. No bodies of water, pools, lakes, decorative? Nope. It's just ground. It's built in the center of this district, and everything's either built or shaped around it. Does it look like it's been there for a really long damn time?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Acrobatics,"I absolutely would love it. Okay, I want to see if I can boost off of Fjord and maybe get up to this tower. Does it look like these are bricks that can-- 25 feet is pretty far. It's very high. Wait, 25 feet, 45 feet? 25 feet's a lot. This is the world's largest mimic. No, and to help the visual thing, I said 100 feet wide diameter. That's a bit wide for what I was originally thinking. It's about maybe 60 feet. In diameter. But can I climb up to the balcony? That's your estimation from this fore point.",Make an acrobatics check.
Investigation,"dive, right? It's a low-life area. I thought The Skew was the low-life area. No, The Skew is a place where you can live. Yeah, it's a heavily residential district for the more affordable and cheaper residents. Is the Quay inside The Skew? No. The Meandering Treasurer? The Meandering Treasurer is a shop. Is a shop. Is there a bar?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Persuasion,"perhaps, cherie."" Judging by your physique though you must be quite excellent on the water. ""Yeah, I'd say so."" I'm sure you're an asset to any vessel. Now that I've buttered you up-- how about-- have you ever heard of Marius LePual? ""Why you asking?"" Oh! ""If I m-might inquire."" Well as one green to another, we were just told that he might be around and he has some information that we were looking for. We are actually trying to deliver him a bit of correspondence.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Persuasion,"""(laughs) M-M-Marius ain't really what you'd call sea-trekking folk. More of a slimy, shadow ""word peddler. However, last time I saw him not but maybe a week ago, I recall he was complaining. ""Waiting on something to be delivered. Never found its way around. Was getting real-- that boy owes a ""lot of money."" I'll have to say that we might be the answer he's looking for. We're removed from the actual situation. We're more delivery by happenstance more than anything else. We have our own questions and problems and concerns which can only be answered by someone who has a better grasp of the situation.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Insight,"woman, probably late 40s, early 50s or so, with a very big mass of hair that goes from a dark brown, to a gray, to white at the tips, almost like a mane. Dark skin, looks weathered from lots of travel and probably seen quite a bit in her day. A light brown coat that hangs over the edge of the chair she's sitting in. They're all looking at you guys because you all come storming in here, cause this ruckus, talking to the tortle. I have a dog that's peeing on shit. Yeah, you guys aren't the most subtle of arrivals. Is she giving us a quizzical look, a suspicious look, an interested look?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Insight,"It's just called the Sluice. Oh yeah, that's right. That's where the guy that's causing the problem is, but it seems super complicated. We got to find out some info. Yeah. Do you know anyone who knows how to get down to the Sluice Weave, or has ever been there, by any chance? ""What are you talking about?"" I don't actually know what I'm talking about, to be fair. ""I don't either, my apologies. I don't know."" Insight?",MATT: Make an insight check.
History,"""Yeah, half-elf fella? Yeah, he was in here a few months back when I was last docked in Nicodranas. Working with that lowlife, Cadmus. Haven't seen him since, though."". Cadmus, you said? ""Cadmus Leeland. You know Cadmus Leeland?"" The name rings a bell. ""He's a right fuckface, I'll tell you that."" A few months, you say? ""Yeah."" Capnis or Cadmus? Cadmus. Does the name ring a bell?",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"being unloaded and is busy on that end. Not that far off of it, the next dock that shoots out and turns to the right, there looks like there's a couple of anchored ships there. It's a little less busy, looks like they're currently moored there and not a lot of folks are doing business on or around the ships, other than just keeping a watch on the docks themselves. Should I secure us a rowboat? Is that something you can do? Pretty sure I can. Then yeah! Is there a ship shack, or something that would lease vessels?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"take my hair-- Yeah, but you don't have hair on the side of your head, so. (laughter) Well, here. I'll just use this side, right? Yep. Give it the old-- Yeah! Fierce. Is that good? Does that work? Yep. Yeah. Do I find the most insecure-looking guy and then use that? I like it, go with it. All right, I go to the most insecure-looking guy.",MATT: Make a general insight check to try and
Persuasion,"some help. You can see his eyes roll and he goes, ""What can I do to help you, then?"" Well, you see, I'm from out of town-- I'm Tracy, by the way. What's your name? He sighs heavily and reaches out and finally takes the hand. He goes, ""Hello, I am Zolezzo Merpol."" Merpol, hi. It's just, you know, I'm here and I'm trying to get the true Nicodranas experience while I'm in town and, you know, I just, I've heard rumors from people, you know, about this thing called the Sluice Weave. And you know, I would just love to see it, see if it's real, you know?",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"ocean! ""Yeah, there's two or three, I think, that are right down off the side-- Here, come here."" And he leads you over. We're all just aghast. Just like-- I turn to Fjord and I go (gagging sound). (laughs) He leads you over across the dock for a bit. And he points down in the water and goes, ""I think somewhere in this vicinity there is sort of the intake tube or pipe, where the ocean ""water is brought in to the Sluice ducts."" Sounds like it's got a lot of suction in the intake.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"boat, the two of you, I think you said you're staying off to the side? Jester and Fjord? I guess so. We're getting into the water and we'll just either hold on to the back, or if we have rope on the dock, I'll just tie four foot-- Yeah, there's extra rope available. So you guys swim beneath as it continues off through the water. As we're untying the boat-- Right? It's tied up? As we're untying the boat, I'm going to hide behind a pillar. Okay. Do we see her?",MATT: We'll find out. Roll a stealth check.
Perception,"And I have my hand on Nott's shoulder, doing that thing. Okay. So, there is a circular pipe entrance or a tunnel entrance 40 feet down, right as the water gets darker and more murky. Bits of clustered seaweed begin to come up and tickle the bottoms of Frumpkin's tentacles in that vicinity. Elements of it are blocking the front, but you can clearly see there is a dark tunnel that continues into the earth, beneath the city, beneath the docks. You don't know how far it goes, necessarily. Do Frumpkin and I see anything alive or moving down here?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"that one continues on for a bit. Muttering all this as it happens. Is there any air between the water and the grate? There is no air between the water and the grate. This is all water. Yeah. It's all water up, and then there's the grate, and then it turns into this tunnel that continues inward, and there's about a foot of water beyond that, and then there's air from that point. I'm going to speed him back to the first grate, and have him took for the locking mechanism if there is one.",MATT: Make an investigation check for Frumpkin.
Investigation,"14? You can still mutter the incantation underwater. (gurgling) I think you said last campaign that you can hold the air for one spell, possibly. Yeah, in the process of casting a spell, if you're holding your breath, that's your breath. (garbled) Go fuck yourself. That's the way to do it. Looking, there is no locking mechanism. The grate isn't one that opens and closes. it's not a door, it's just in place. Okay. So he will swirl away and go back to the second and do the same look around.",MATT: Another investigation check.

Perception,"seem to be placed there intentionally for an indefinite period of time. Okay. All right, buddy. 17. 17? You see a number of fish swirling through the various bits of kelp and seaweed that are pushing up from the bottom of the bay below. It's beautiful. You can see the colors and glistening bits of silver as the fish curl through the sunlight, but nothing catches your attention as dangerous in your immediate vicinity, thankfully. Could I look to see if anyone's watching us out on the shore?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Athletics,"another tunnel continues on, almost like this is just a waypoint chamber. On the right side, you maybe a foot and a half, two feet across, with a more dense cross-lattice of bars. Not able for Frumpkin to squeeze through that, I'm guessing. Frumpkin's size? How big of an octopus is Frumpkin? An octopus, I'd say it would be about that big. I'm imagining I am not summoning a gigantic octopus. But octopuses can squeeze through some pretty small spaces. Yeah, so I'd say make an",athletics check for tiny octopus Frumpkin.
Perception,"Looks like basic stonework, it has a slight curvature to it but it's probably placed in here either as a load bearing piece since this is beneath a heavier city or-- It doesn't look remarkable or have any other purpose beyond just being a support pillar. Are Frumpkin and I able to tell if this goes water all the way to the ceiling of this chamber or is it water with air above? Or it's all water? The water only goes up to a foot, and then it's air for the rest of it. It's about ten or so feet tall, the chamber. Okay. Is there anything out of the ordinary if he pokes his head up out of the water?",MATT: Make a perception check?
Athletics,"(squealing) (splash) Going under water, you hear the-- (still squealing) The diminishing squeak as it slowly vanishes beneath the surface.

I've slowed my breathing, I've calmed myself and I'm just going to take a very gentle dive and move in. And we tied the boat, yeah? I think so. Yeah, we tied the boat. I will ask you to make an athletics check because you are swimming mostly with one arm and your legs, as you are cradling the puppy with the other.","TALIESIN: Athletics check, that one was not so"
Athletics,"past that point, look up, you push off. Oh god! You're tired, your lungs are starting to hurt from just the amount of effort it's taking to go this distance with one arm and your legs kicking. You've waded in the ponds near the graveyard-- Never done this before. You're not a practiced swimmer. Yeah do you have hooves? I can thankfully hold my breath a long time. Correct, the puppy though-- The puppy is having-- am I feeling a twitch, or is it having a--?","MATT: Not yet, no. Make another athletics check--"
Insight,"I'll put him in my hood and stuff and warm up. He curls up in there. Where's Caleb? Yeah I'm here. I would have beat Caduceus here, because he was struggling. I'm so proud of you! You made it all this way. I just had a feeling overcome me, that I was-- I've never done anything like that before. Do you know what the good news is? You're going to have that feeling for the next seven hours and 50 minutes. It's not real, is it? (laughing)",LIAM: Make an insight check.
Perception,"Nine. 12. (exertion noise) You get the sense-- first off, your fingers are sore and your arms are strained from the two previous exerts that you've given. And you've done impressive things, but you get the sense that this is probably-- because it's smaller, it's wedged into a little tighter in the small tunnel. The actual tunnel there is maybe about a foot across, a foot and a half across. Most of you would not even fit through it, but you're unable to get it to budge at all. Can we see through it at all? What's in there?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"more of a-- Looking around, it resembles a subterranean sewer, it's mostly just stone and masonry that's slick from the moisture. And the air itself is very humid down here. There is a lot of moisture that gathers across the stone, and there's streaks of color and minerals that have gathered on the walls over time. You still have the taste of the brine in your mouth from your time under the ocean, but the air in here is still also very ocean-like and salty. Does it seem like water is ever up along the walls, or does it seem like the water is always at the level it's at?",MATT: Make an investigation check..
Perception,"if there's any writing on the wall? 18. Looking at it, there are certain markers and the levels that say that there have at times been different levels of water in here, but it doesn't seem often enough, like certain levels of minerals and sediment that you can see. But a lot of them seem older, and haven't been reached in a while. Okay, I think we're safe. You're looking for writing? You don't see any writing. No type of directional marks? Any type of, using my background, any types of Thieves' Cant for smuggling?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"out with both of its fists towards Jester. As it strikes her, its midsection just turns into bits of foam and sea water as it splashes against her armor and shield. I hate water! Fjord, I am your dream! Yeah. See? No big deal. (panting heavily) Big deal! Water's your friend. Water is terrible. It tried to kill us! It actively wants to kill us! Are there any drains on the floor as we walk around? As you glance around, keeping an eye out,",make an investigation check.
Perception,Yeah. I am ripped to fuck. How many stones do you weigh? So many. What size are the stones? Just curious. They're a pound each. What are you talking about? I'm talking about-- What? Perhaps we should continue. I just tap the stone. Ten hit points. Wait. Is he ten stones? Where does this tunnel go? Where does that next tunnel go? The other one? The one that had to be there? Go ahead and,make a perception check.
Nature,"Splash, splash, splash. Yasha, you do it. Okay. I got a five. It's a lot of water ahead. And some walls. It's just a lot of water and I think just more stone walls. Nothing treacherous? That's very astute. I don't think it's bad. Is there an intense discoloration, maybe, of the mold underneath the grate? Is it a different kind of-- Oh, on the smaller one, you mean? Yeah.",MATT: Make a nature check.
Investigation,"Make a nature check. I'm going to kick through the barrel while he's doing that. Did I find a gold? It breaks fairly easy. The wood is very soaked and warped. And as your foot breaks through it, it's now up to the knee inside of the barrel. Doesn't shatter, you're now stuck with your leg partially in a barrel. You're so good. And you guys already checked the pillar for any-- We looked around for writing and stuff, but. Can I give the pillar a look-see?",MATT: Make an investigation check. You eventually
Animal Handling,"So Caleb's in the very back. Yeah. Who's next, Nott, or? I think Beau is offering to not let me fall, faceplant. I'm right next to him. Okay. And Nugget's going to run up and try to bite and play with Frumpkin. Okay. So as you're making your way through the water, this puppy is trying to dog paddle from the foot and a half of water ""(whimpering)."" Oh shit, it's a foot and a half. Nugget, come back here. Blink to me, darling, blink to me!",MATT: Roll an animal handling check.
Perception,"You didn't have to buy it. I know we didn't! Jester, you're starting to smell like Caleb. (gasps) Wet dog and wet weasel. All over your neck. I'll take a really good bath when we get back. We move on. Your knee smells bad. Oh no! Yeah, you stank. No! Moving forward. Caleb is laughing quietly in the dark.",MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.
Stealth,"can see the interior of this chamber and the display that Caleb had described. Caduceus, as you guys are stepping up, you hear this faint echoing sound emerging from the upper left hallway. You see a very faint bit of light coming, and you hear talking. This is through Frumpkin? No, this is Caduceus. I cast Pass Without a Trace. Do I have that? I do. Yeah, I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. I'm casting Mage Armor. We're going to stealth, right? Because I just cast it on all of us.",MATT: Roll some stealth checks.

Acrobatics,"Sick, Matt. Sick. Turn that down just a little bit, there. So, guys-- Ooh! (laughter) It was worth it for me. It was worth it. Thank you for being patient on that one. We're so happy! So worth it! Beau, what are you doing? Okay. I want to do some parkour, awesome dope monk shit, and be like (repeating) bink. And see if I can get to here, 40 feet? Okay, go for it. Can I do that?",MATT: Make an acrobatics check. If you want to
Acrobatics,"Here, you said? Yeah, that's good. Do I-- Fuck, but that doesn't give me-- Fuck butt? Fuck butt. Do I have any more movement? (counting) 25? Can I still try and go further one? With my 45 feet of movement? Let's say from there-- It's a lot of movement, but it's also running off of walls that don't really-- To land off of it you're going to have to land this way. I'm thinking trajectory-wise. Okay I've gone (counting) 20, arguably 25 to 30. Can I just then try and get here?",MATT: Make a secondary acrobatics check because
Arcana,"It says, ""You can control the hand."" But I don't know if that means-- The hand can move 30 feet each time you use it, so it can move and do something. Okay. So who has the necklace? Zsa Zsa? Zsundie? Has a necklace on, but Algar has a bracelet on that's controlling it. I can't see Algar, but Zsundie is the-- It's right there, yeah. He's wearing a necklace? I will bonus action try to steal his necklace. All right. Go ahead and roll an arcana check.",SAM: Arcana check?
Acrobatics,"Have any of you heard of Marius LePual? (laughter) What're you doing, Beau? I'm going to risk the hit and take the dash. All right. So it's going to swing towards you. That is going to be an 18 to hit. Miss! Whoosh, just past you. So my jump distance is also doubled for the turn. Can I be like, parkour, parkour, and jump. I'm going to try and jump up here. Okay, it's still your movement. So if you're wanting to leap off and parkour? All right, so we'll say that's about 20 feet to get there. Go",ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Persuasion,"Where am I? Right there. You can stand up. I'm going to move that way again, past over here. Around Yasha. Algar? Algar is-- No, the Szundie. He's after me. Fuck. I will yell to-- what is it, Szundi? Szundie. Szundie? Junji? I will yell to Szundie, we didn't want to hurt you! We respect and fear water! Look, my feet won't even sink into it, I fear it so much! I bow before you!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Stealth,"fear it so much! I bow before you! Make a persuasion check. Come on! Come on, Nott! Yeah! 11! (laughter) Unmoved, your words fall upon deaf ears as a focused, semi-ethereal water-based elemental entity is steady, his eyes filled with driven command and murder. Anything else you want to do? Bonus action hide! So he's thinking about it? He's thinking about it. Hmm? Bonus action hide! Okay. Go ahead and curl around there. Go",ahead and make your stealth check.
Athletics,"standing over Algar who's (panting) on the ground, scooting away. (out of breath) I made it! I'm here! Okay. What do I-- Okay, I'm going to-- I go over to Algar and I do the MMA thing and I put my knee right to his face and I pin him down. Ooh, yeah. Okay. He's now pinned against the wall, your knee against the jaw and the chin  he's choking against the pressure. Bracelet! And I'm going to just full-on grapple him down and hold him for my action. Pull his bracelet off!",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Athletics,"against the pressure. Bracelet! And I'm going to just full-on grapple him down and hold him for my action. Pull his bracelet off! Make an athletics check. Oh oh! Oh, can I pull his bracelet off? Eh. (meta-gaming pigeon coos) Come on! You had to remember. Make an athletics check. But it was in my head! But it was in my head!",MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple.
Intimidation,"Zsundie is floating towards the back of the chamber, towards where they are. What do you do? Fjord, is he with you? I'm pointing at the spectral guy. He is. So I shouldn't kill him? I don't think so. Might be unwise. You all right, man? Yeah, I want that bracelet. I'll reach down and pick it up. Okay. You pick the bracelet and Algar's like, (groaning, pained panting). I'll hold it in front of his face. You used this to control that?",MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.
Medicine,"He might be dead. Algar? Yeah. I'll give him a little cheek slap. He's definitely passed out. He's not dead, but there is a large amount of blood coming out of his severed stump. I stand next to Caleb and poke his biceps. Ooh! Guys need any help? Should we-- I'll tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my sleeve and I'll wrap it around his forearm like a tight tourniquet.",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Investigation,"Well, I'm going to double check here, but I think if he succeeds in the save he's immune to it for 24 hours. I could be wrong. Let me double check here. Has it been 24 hours yet? Yeah, you can wait 24 hours and then come back to it. Let's just sit here until it's Crash Pandas tomorrow. I'll lean over to Nott and say: Nott, do me a favor and make sure he's not carrying anything fancy in his pockets. I'm going to rifle through all of his pockets with lightning speed agility of hand.","MATT: Make an investigation check, please."
Intimidation,"Yeah, not LePual. No. Demesne. Fjord, ask him if knowledge of that water creature that was here and is gone now, if that is known all the way to the top, or is it his bag, or-- The creature that was here and the magic used to control him, is that something that you brought to the table, or was that a device given to you and known in the higher ranks of government? He's resisting answering. I dig that finger into his pressure point a little harder.",MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage
Intimidation,"trouble. Especially, I imagine, if they start looking into everything you did with that kind of power. I mean, having access to that kind of creature, I can't imagine that you were on the up-and-up about everything you did. Especially if you start to admit that you did it all yourself. I'll use Mask of Many Faces to look just like him. People have got to have to start asking questions, serious questions. You hear his head hit the stone once more. ""Who the fuck are you?"" (as Algar) Who the fuck are you?",MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.
Investigation,"fool in any way, we will tear you asunder before you can say ""Ow."" ""I understand."" Do you still look like him? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Is this your office? ""This is my office, yeah."" These people will know this is your office? ""The few that I work with, yes."" Got it. Thank you. (southern accent) I mean, got it, thank you. Caleb, did you find anything? I don't know, did I find anything?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"I'm going to take one and study it. Are you right-handed or left-handed? Well, now he's right-handed. But two hours ago, were you right-handed or left-handed? ""I was left-handed."" Ooh. That's a bitch. He'll never play piano. Hey, I'm left-handed. I'm looking for anywhere where there might be a secret stash or something that looks off-kilter or a little odd in here, somewhere where he might be hiding something.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"far away, is the old fisherman you had spoken to earlier that you had borrowed it from. You gather your things out of it and he comes over and is like, ""Well, I appreciate you bringing this back."" It's no problem. I think I've had enough ocean for a while. That was-- ""No such thing. No such thing!'"" Have a good day! ""You too, tall one."" What do we do now? I turn around and I look at the city. Do I notice... commerce? Does it look like things are slowing down?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"What do we do now? I turn around and I look at the city. Do I notice... commerce? Does it look like things are slowing down? Make a perception check. Are we now Bane? Well, that was a garbage roll. Seven. That's terrible. It looks like the city. I mean, at this point in the day, it's getting a little later. The sky is starting to get a bit-- maybe the oranges of dusk are starting to peek in a little bit. You maybe have another hour or so of daylight. Do I see Merpol anywhere?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Arcana,"your way back to the Open Quay. Heading towards the tower, you can see, as you approach, based on whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision, you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get to it, to the point where it's massively towering when you're right below it. Still no sign of a door, at first glance. You still have the 20-foot-up or so balcony and a few other windows up that way. You can see the top two windows have, now that it's gotten darker, you can there's a little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of it. Have I ever read about anything like this? A building that seems to shift in size.",MATT: Make an arcana check.

Animal Handling,"way, and there's a coat rack where Professor Thaddeus is sitting on there, staring at him. As you enter the chamber-- Hey. ""Oh, hey."" Is my bird okay? You can see there's some scratches on his cheek. ""Yeah, he's fine. Just watching him right there."" Uh-huh. You didn't traumatize him, did you? I think not? Hard to feed these. Yeah, I know. I grab the food that I just took from my plate and I'm like, ""Thaddeus, come. Thaddeus?""",MATT: Roll an animal handling check.
Animal Handling,"found a brief perch up into the roof chamber. Oh, you've all seen an owl before, shut up! I think they're worried about the-- (whistles) It'll be fine. Caleb summons Frumpkin the octopus and I rub his head like a Bond villain, staring at Beau. Squeaks like a balloon. I'm going to pull one of the beetles out of my staff and say, ""Professor, you want a snack?"" I hold it up. You're holding the beetle? Yeah.",MATT: Make an animal handling check.
Animal Handling,"Maybe. The weasel and the owl? No, the weasel's staying with me. I know, it's such a temptation. I know, I want to eat that weasel so bad! Are we going to go down to the docks? Yeah. Is it almost midnight? Yeah, it's getting close. About 11, 11:20. Yeah. Let's go. Mm-hmm. All right. I try-- Professor Thaddeus! You want to come?",MATT: Make one more animal handling check.
Perception,"of view, the creaking of wet wood filling the air as the docks shift and the number of boats that are currently moored to the center of the harbor creak from side to side as the water comes in. Every now and then, you see the slow glowing beam of the Lighthouse pass overhead about once a minute or so. It's a very slow moving, pulsing rhythm. Now ships of varying sizes sit across the dock spread, tied to their various posts, all seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber. There's no one doing any sort of evening work on these ships at this hour. You see a handful of zolezzo patrolling up and down the sides of the dock doing their rounds, no urgency or direction","necessarily. Make a perception check, if you don't"
Stealth,"I mean, it's pretty quiet. Other than that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates, there's really nothing to see. Is he blond? Is he a blond half-elf? It's really dark. I don't know. Other than that, there's nothing really happening. There's a guy darting. Should I go dart after him? Ooh. Yes. Are we playing darts? Wait, do you want-- Blessing of the Trickster! Ah! What does that do?",LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks!
Stealth,"feet from where he's sitting. I wonder what he's waiting for. Yeah. Looks like someone that's waiting for a handoff if I've seen them. I wonder how much he paid to bribe the guard. Apparently five gold is a great going rate. That's true. That's what we did. Yeah. Huh. Seeing as there's no guard, I'm going to dart over towards where he's hiding, but not right on him or anything, across the way.",MATT: Make a stealth check with advantage.
Perception,"Stealth? 17. Okay. You make your way over to the side of the docks on the opposite end and there's a little step up from this edge of the street and you have a few buildings begin to give way. The road ends and there are bits of it that break off and fall off the short cliffs into the water. There's the docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of the dock that's out of the way, but it's blocking a lot of the view on this side. The ship that this figure is focused on and the crates that he's by on one side. You get to the other and keeping quiet. You don't think you've been noticed. Mm-hmm.

You guys see that? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't see that, and you're not close enough to hear any of this.

What do the figures look like?",MATT: Make a perception check for you if you want
Acrobatics,"between that and the dock where the figures are stepping up. They're meeting right where that gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed. Hey, Fjord? You've got that fancy armor that helps you float. Do you think maybe you could get underneath the docks? Overhear something? Yeah, I like that. I'll run and-- staying a good distance in-- I'll drop off the docks under the water and start swimming. SEAL team. All right. Go ahead and make a-- How do I want to do this?

Performance,"That's your autobiography title! There you go. I walked into that one. Make an acrobatics check for me, Fjord. No splash, no splash! Ten points! Five.

Deception,"start looking over towards the initial figure that you were following and are looking really aggressive towards them. The figure's hands are up and are like-- (stammering). There's this heated conversation going. The figures in the ship are getting things at the ready that you can't see, but it looks like they are very much on guard. The two that were talking, one of them grabs the scruff of the figure and holds him there, while the other one, blade drawn, begins to approach the edge of the dock where that noise came from. I turn to Caleb and I go: There! I threw our engagement ring and our life and I fed it to the rabies dolphins! It's over, okay?! It's over!",MATT: Make a deception check.

Well, I was going to say, the Misty Step, is it on a short rest or a long rest that it gets back? It is every short or long rest. Gotcha, perfect. With my action, I will use Thunder Step.

You watch as he goes from this arrogant, watching you flounder in front of him as he takes the blows and keeps grinning, suddenly double over as the bolt is now deeply buried into his abdomen. Yeah, that was a pretty tough hit. He's hurt! Then I will, bonus action, jump in that box-- (laughter) --and hide. Oh, that's so cute.",MATT: (laughs) Roll a stealth check.
Athletics,"(laughter) She slips on some slick dock wood and slides right into him. It's a rough night out here in Nicodranas. (laughter) There we go. Fucking power plants are shutting down-- There you go. You're up on the gangplank with him now. Can I grab him and tackle him down behind these barrels? Can I try and drag him back?

Acrobatics,"Would it help make full speed when it comes back to Beau's turn if she's assisting? Can they double pull? Can she go, and then I assist on my turn? I'll allow it. Yeah. I guess do you want me to roll to grapple? Yes, because he is resisting amongst her grapple as well, and it's harder to do that. 15 plus her natural strength. Yeah. All right, now it's Marius's turn.

Persuasion,"feet more, so you leap down onto his crumpled unconscious body, and his other friend is going to pull back to try and take a shot while he's backing up towards the back portion of the ship. I go: Melee range, you can't do it! And then a 19? That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage. Big money. Okay! Nine. Die! Die! And so he-- You (impact sound), and he falls unconscious onto the ground. I turn to Marius and I say ""The Gentleman sent us? Gentleman? You a Gentleman?"" He's like (startled gasping). Make a",persuasion check.
Persuasion,"No, no. Hold on. Marius moves past Yasha. Do I get an attack of bitch slapping? He gets up to the top of the edge of the ship. And... let me roll for him to see if-- that's actually pretty good, okay. He glances about the scenario, takes in his chances and what's happening, and stands up and goes, ""Hold! Hold please! This is a big misunderstanding! ""Let's talk this out!"" To us, or everybody? To the guards. For the sake of this, I'm going to have one of you guys roll for him. Who wants to roll his-- I will roll.",MATT: Persuasion check with disadvantage.
Athletics,"I hate water! (laughter) Nott, what are you doing? Is anything constraining our movement? Is the gangplank in our way? Or are we unfettered at this point? As far as you know, the gangplank is resting on there. You don't know if it's connected at all. We're starting to drift a little? You're starting to drift a little bit.

Those are the arrows, are the ping-pong points that you have to hit and then you get to the island that you-- Yeah, well otherwise you wreck the ship. You recognise those specific points there?

Well, I hope we find it, because then you'd get to figure out what to do next, and then there'll be two of us who would be wondering. Fair enough. Okay.

Perception,"Natural 20. [cheering] She tugs down the scarf to reveal the tattoo without breaking eye contact and goes, ""I'll do ""you one better."" [cheering] Zip? Removes the glove off of her right hand, and in the palm you see a familiar yellow eye emerging from the center. ""This is the blessing. It leaves the first stage. I have been chosen to be one step ""to his unsealing."" Like, a fucking eye or a tattoo of an eye?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yep. Question. I am still watching her. [cheering] What the fuck do you mean ""still""? [cheering] I know it's confusing  I like to stay inside this Zemnian accent so much, but I did not say that out loud. That was for the DM. Oh, shit. Question, Caleb? Yeah, I did not stop watching her after he left. Right. What is she doing?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"the visual perspective, and spends a minute or so looking over the water. Then turns back, goes and closes the door, walks over to underneath the main doorway, where that shrine is. She pulls a stool up to stand up to about eye level to where the shrine is. Then she pulls her glove off once more, makes a small cut on her finger, and drops a few pieces of blood onto the small iron shrine. It's maybe about that big and then puts the glove back on, mumbles a few words beneath her breath, though Frumpkin might not able to see from this perspective. Then goes ahead and snuffs the candles. So she did some arcane shit. Did she also look very hot and bothered?","MATT: With that perception roll, I'd say you don't"
Perception,"sword, do I see anything? You look towards the hilt and the eye stares back at you. The light temporarily blinding you for a moment, as you adjust. What the fuck? Can I try and take the edge of the blade and press it into the floor? You press the blade in through the water and it hits the stone. Jesus. (English accent) I don't know what you want from me! No response. Then you hear once more, ""Watch."" I've stared at the eye. Fuck. I have no idea.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"surge of strength. Of control, of purpose. The voice again says, ""Reward."" As you look up around you the stone falls away and on the distance you can see that horizon once more. Now an endless ocean. You can see the faint ripples of waves across a sourceless bit of moonlight. There you see dozens of ships coming towards you. What do you do? Can I look behind myself real fast? You turn behind you and it is just darkness. Inky, infinite. A shit load of ships coming towards me. Cool. Are there any pigeons in this dream? (laughter)",MATT: Make a perception check.
Insight,"As the rest of you come to consciousness in the morning, Fjord seems to be sleeping in a little bit before suddenly shooting up with a gasp. Did you have a dream? (English accent) What? (regular voice) No, no, I didn't. You're drenched in sweat. Just throwing that out there. Yeah. Real soggy. Yeah, no, we were fighting crazy beasts and monsters and all this talk of serpents, I feel-- Fjord! Are you lying?",MATT: Make an insight check. Make a deception
Stealth,"hair and the back of your coat. Caleb would then have taken his coat off and twisted it up and tied it to the back of his coat, so he's just with the holstered books and his shirt sleeves rolled up at this point since it's so hot. So you're leaving the coat behind? No, I just tied it onto the back of my pack. Ok, gotcha. Cool. Rolled it up like a carpet. You begin to step through the soft floor of the island jungle, each footstep coming with a sort of spongy pressure before it hits hard earth, rock, or just compressed compost and soft",vegetation. I need you all to roll a stealth check
Perception,"this? Me, and-- I'm keeping an eye out. Who am I out there with? Cosko? Jamedi. Oh, and Frumpkin. Yeah, and Caduceus please. I'm keeping an eye around as well. All right. Go ahead and roll perception for your vicinity. You guys are rolling perception for the path ahead of you. Three. What the fuck? Plus? Plus zero.",TRAVIS: Why are you rolling perception checks?
Investigation,"threads separate a little bit. Peering inside, you see it's mostly empty. There's a simple cot, there's a chair, a mildewed leather coat that appears to be half folded over and thrown in the corner, and a small box up on the far end of the table in the room that's just open  there's no lid to it. The whole room smells faintly of rot. (pigeon cooing) Shh. I'm going to poke up and put my head in as well. There's no trap doors? Nowhere where anybody could be hiding? I can look for traps.",MATT: You can make an investigation check
Perception,"up and put my head in as well. There's no trap doors? Nowhere where anybody could be hiding? I can look for traps. You can make an investigation check if you want to go check the interior. I was just curious immediately if there was anything I notice  I wasn't going to-- I'll look around for traps on the floor and stuff. I was going to look around. Actually, if you're doing that, I'll look around the outside to see if anybody's watching us.",MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.
Investigation,"maps, but the wooden elements of these have warped over time and dried out and there are metallic bits are rusted a bit. Does the magnifying glass look like it might still work, maybe? It could still work. The glass hasn't been touched  the housing for it has rusted a little. I'll grab that. Mr. Clay, should we go in further, or what do you think? I don't know. Has the bed been slept in? Does it seem like someone's been here recently or is this abandoned, do you think? Why don't you go check it out? What? Oh! Well, I'll put my head in.",MATT: Roll an investigation check as you inspect
Investigation,"that along. You, through your cantrip, manage to watch as these dull blue and gray spores begin to apparate in a row across the pile of somewhat sludgy snake remains. That's already better. Were they real rubies or was it all a ruse to get me to pull on them? They appear to be. Do I have them? You have them. You have everything that's in the chest, you have the gold idol, the small snake head idol, and you have these three gold piece-shaped rubies. They're about that thick, and",that big around. Make an investigation check.
Perception,"there. You finish casting Identify. This is not magical, it doesn't have any magical properties. It seems to be just an idol, it looks like it was attached to something in the past, but it's probably literally worth its weight in gold. Nott, here's your toy back. Thank you. I have a question for you, Matt. Is it really just us and Avantika and Jamedi? Yeah. And that's it? Yeah. I scan the forest. Are we being followed?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"""I hope not either."" She reaches out and pokes your nose and turns around. She booped you. Nope. She just gets a finger full of sweat. Was all of that for all to hear or are they off a bit? They were off a bit, away from everybody. Are we satisfied? Let's go, let's keep going. Oh, what? Yeah, I'm good. Break time over. All right. ""All right. Jamedi?"" ""Of course."" They begin falling into the same positions, with both Jamedi and Nott taking point. Everybody make another","stealth check, please."

Nature,"front of him on myself. Thank you. See you later. I'm going back to my earlier position. All right. Continuing forward for the next few hours or so, the heat is getting heavier and heavier as the afternoon sky now greets you. You find yourself stopping to eat and drink water along the way with what supplies you have available to you. The next few hours or so as it begins to get darker and darker-- I have a question. Yes? With my medicine stuff, would I know anything that would help get rid of bugs and stuff? That would keep bugs away from me?",MATT: It's possible. Make a nature check.
Persuasion,"Great. Ahem. Hoy hoy! Hi, Captain Avantika. And Jamedi. Jamedi's a few feet ahead. He's currently leading the path. They're about 20 feet from each other. Oh, sorry. I'll get Jamedi. Sure. Hey, Jamedi! Jamedi is like, ""What?"" Can you come here for a second? I have something I need to show you. ""What is this? This has no bearing on--"" It's really important, though. It's super important.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"that are made of makeshift, scavenged metal or weapons that have washed up on shore or have been recovered from others that have been unlucky to make their way to this island and never returned. How many? Four of them. Each one of them has a spear. I duck down, I turn to the rest of the (whispering) Snake. Four of them. Shields. Weapons. That's a bad gesture. I quickly turn around and through the wire (whispering) There's four lizard people over here. Looking in the distance at them and at Jamedi.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Investigation,"""So I have noticed."" Did you see his arms? ""I did. It was quite frightening."" Oh my god. Imagine if it was his legs. How would he even walk? ""It is a very good question. One that will keep me up late at night."" Yeah. You're not sure if he's joking. Do you guys do anything else or you just let them pass and continue on? We're going to let them go. Did they leave anything on the ground? Did they leave anything? Did they drop anything?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"I also want to cast another Detect Undead, while we're walking. You're going to look around what? I'm going to take a walk around this little ruin. I'm going to have the little Light spell up, see if there's any writing on anything, any carvings. I'm going to have Eyes of the Grave up again. I'm going to be looking for any undead. Okay. And you're accompanying him? I'm watching his back! The rest of you are staying within the sphere, gray color, dimly lit on the interior? It can be whatever light source you want at this point. The two of you wander around the ruin. Make","an investigation check, if you don't mind."
Stealth,"sound and seeing all these folks over here. Okay, so you leave the thing, you can see everyone right there. Do I see the beast? You do. You see that one beast right there. I will kneel down and pew, shoot it in its hindquarters. That's a miss. 12. 12 does not hit. Reload. Fire again. Wait, do I want to do this? Nope. I'll keep moving and hide behind that wall. Right here? Yeah. All righty. Bonus action hide.",MATT: Role a stealth check.
Perception,"What did you do? I shot it with the thing. I'll light it up with this crackling green Eldritch Blast energy coming from both of my palms, causing its fur to smoke and burn off and its snake heads to repel! Oh my god, that's so visceral and amazing. I'll shoot it in the nose. Its torso erupts in green flame and energy, just (explosion). The body slinks to the ground in a smoldering cinder and as it's head (moaning), (arrow impact). I'll look over at Nott. You guys all take a moment.

Jester, you come to consciousness and you're half-curled on Avantika, who's half-curled on you since you guys passed out right next to each other.

Nature,"wall take up some of the bubble space, or we can be right next to this wall. We made a bit of a ruckus, that's the last thing you want to do in a jungle. Are we what? Are you okay? Uh. You don't look very good, Mr. Clay. Thank you. I'm going to Cure Wounds. On yourself? Yeah. Did they seem like intelligent beasts? I'm going to do it to you, too.

""But in my line of work, it's important to not hesitate when some drunk asshole tries to, I ""don't know, take your ship."" We can't relate at all, nope. ""Well, anyway.

Perception,"come back anytime you want. Okay, just checking. But please don't go on any walkabouts while we are sleeping. I'm not going to, Caleb. But you already did. Well, that was for Caduceus. Don't worry about it, okay? Do you promise? Of course I promise. I'm going to stay in here. That is good enough for me. Good night. Good night. (snoring)",MATT: Make a perception check.
Survival,"Okay well, say the word and I'll pull it down. Let's get everything together first. Yeah. Jamedi? Following you. ""All right, collect your belongings."" He goes over and starts disassembling his tent quickly, rolling it up and putting it into his pack over his shoulder. You guys gather your things. Should we make the brush look like we weren't sleeping on it and stuff? Why? You know, so that they won't be able to like--","MATT: Make a survival check, Beau."

Jamedi, ""lead the way."" ""All right come forward."" You all begin to slowly make your way into the jungle as you cast Pass Without a Trace and we'll come back at the end of the break. Whoa! Owl on your head. There you go. Oh no god! Stealth owl. All right, we're going to take a quick break and come back to that with that",stealth check and this next leg of the journey
Stealth,"and general atmosphere. Beau, you're feeling a little rough. Ah? What? You get this sweating a little bit and this soreness in your body and this general body pain, kind of a dull pain throughout. You've got mono. Nope. I'm great. Just kind of (sighs)... you're not quite sure why it's come over you. Pressing on, Jamedi leads you for about another hour and a half, two hours through the jungle before putting his hand up once more to stop you all. Oh we didn't make",the stealth check actually. Because I said when
Perception,"actually up the way across one of these walls, you see four figures that are strung up by their feet. You can see the remnants of the lizard men that are in the process of having the flesh filleted from their bodies. (moans of disgust) You see one of the more humanoid ones, probably one of the hunters that you saw alongside the snake-armed man, is there with the blade, stripping it off the bones and sloughing it into a pile next to it where you hear (squelching) over on top of each other. Oh that's fucked up. What do the obelisk eyes look like?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Medicine,"but not lingering? Oh yeah, I'm feeling fine. Are you? I'm not, like, saying anything. Why? What? You seem a little-- Nope! You sure? Yep! I can do a-- Nope. Great. Do you feel okay? Yeah. Does she look okay?",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Medicine,"her and casting Lesser Restoration. Don't think I've never done this before. Smell this. Bip. Okay. You finish casting the spell, the energy subsides, you pull back and there's no change in her demeanor. Oh no. Don't touch me. I apologize. That's weird, though. Oh I'm sorry, I was wrong: she's just a bitch. I get that a lot. You really don't look okay. Just for fun, really quickly--","MATT: Based on your medicine check, it looks to be"
Perception,"What, act like you're tied up? Maybe. Yeah, we'll do it anyway. That's if they see us. We'll tie your hands in the front. If they don't see us, it doesn't matter what they look like. Okay, okay. I think that if anyone that looks like me or you shows up on this island, anyone who sees it is going to come asking questions immediately. I agree. What if-- do any of the people we see walking around, do any of them wear cloaks?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"sent to come get us to bring us back as feeding for whatever's down there? (whispering) What if we let the pirate queen tie rocks to our feet and we're dead?! We have to do this! We can kill them later! Agreed. ""Agreed."" Ah! You're still here?! Shit! ""Well, I hadn't left yet. I was curious to see your--"" Did you know? Where are you? You don't see, the voice is coming from nowhere. Is Jamedi here?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"We should probably get pretty snaking on here. We'll put two in the front, two in the back, and put these three in the-- In the middle. Your Pass Without a Trace has probably faded at this point, with the travel you've made so you have to recast it to get the spell bonus. You guys, we should probably do it again? Mm-hmm. Yeah. (singing) Pass pass pass pa-pass. I give Yasha the Blessing of the Trickster. Good call.","MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, please."
Stealth,"Everyone make a stealth check, please. Hang on, hang on, real quick: (clearing throat) Real talk, for just a second. If Yasha comes with us, and we puppet her, and she dies, Ashley's going to be real mad. Just pointing this out last time, because we did this with Pike. Not saying one way or the other! Just saying, we're going to continue on with Yasha? Okay. Done. Done. That's all I'm going to say. She's going to be in a defensive stance for most of the fight. She'll be fine. I'll pilot her. I would say let's text her, but she's in another country, so she probably wouldn't get it.","MATT: Stealth checks, guys."
Deception,"bent into slave labor for these people. They are now pushing it forward. That catches you off guard for a minute, but you continue to focus and move forward. As you get closer, you can hear the slick sound of the flesh being pulled from the back of the lizardman's body-- (wet ripping) Aww, yeah! Onto the side-- (coughing) Had me a little bit of spittle on that one. (coughing) Pardon me. Moving around the side, the figure finishes and throws it, and glances over and looks at your group. Starts looking somewhat curiously as you pass. (hissing)","MATT: Make a deception check, Jester."

I'm going to go listen to your tapes, your level seven tapes. A most expeditious movement towards the temple, I suppose, would be the-- Do we look in the window? As he's saying this, you glance to the window to your left, and as you look in, make a",perception check.
Deception,"sheet, you would have the benefits of knowing that. But, not my responsibility. So you pick you on it and the muttering is akin to, ""Come, we have ""to pick up the hunts. The food stores are running dry this season."" As that comes to you, you glance up to the side and you guys watch as two figures round the corner. They're both mostly human in body, though their bodies are scaled and a dull green-gray color. Their heads, fully serpentine, snake jaws-- the hood's not open, but retracted-- and they both have, strapped across their shoulders and torsos, longbows that are at rest, and they have quivers filled with arrows. They walk past and glance over at the rest of your","crew. Make a deception check, Jester."
Perception,"Run. Yeah, we're picking up and moving expeditiously away. I really should've charmed them instead of held them, but let's go. Yeah, or distraction. Want to do a distraction now? Not now. We've got to go. Distraction is them. They are currently paralyzed in the middle of the street for the next minute. Once they're released, they're going to do whatever they do. Do we seen anyone else around besides those two?",MATT: Right now? Make a perception check.
Perception,"street. You and Yasha should pull them off the street. You guys lift their arms and pull them off. Weekend at Bernie's. Are there any doors around here? The building to the left of you was the one that you saw the craftsman in. The one to the right, you can see there is an open doorway. Is there anybody in there? Let's just go in? All right, you drag them over. I'm going to walk forwards first to peek in because I look like a snake.","MATT: Okay, make a perception check."
Deception,"You put that behind where the serpent was? Yes, so he has to turn and move away from us. Okay. You guys arc in the completely opposite direction heading towards where the base of this temple is. There is another one of those that is currently at the bottom of the stairway that is making its way in your direction. I point at the manticore. You point at the manticore? I can't. I point at the manticore. No, you did it. She's the one who did it. Hey man, I look like a snake person!",MATT: Make a deception check.
Acrobatics,"You had to beat a ten. You push, and it turns around and sees the manticore and looks at you curiously. It has to take a moment to decide which is more dangerous, the manticore or this curious serpent. Goes ahead and grabs you by the chest and begins dragging you with it. It makes a grab for her? Yeah. It can't choose, so it just grabs you. Blindness. I'm going to blind him before he grabs her. Okay. Well first, it has to try and grapple you, so go ahead if you want to fight it.

You bypass that one. Now you're heading up the stairs. Up across the way, there's one of those crotchety snake people that you saw patrolling the upper area who has its longbow out and is currently firing one after another arrow toward the manticore. It's moved off to the side. It doesn't seem to immediately notice your presence as you approach. If you guys are trying to stealth by without getting its attention, I",need you all to make another stealth check now

Glancing off to the side, the manticore still drawing most of the attention, but people are starting to figure out the weirdness about it. Can I use my bonus action to Misty Step up behind them and I will kick them down the stairs towards the rest of us? Ooh. Yes! Yes, you can. Oh my god, yes!

Stealth,"He's at the bottom of the temple. Oh, he went down there? I thought he was at our feet. No, you guys have been climbing the temple and he kicked him down off the side of it. It's all good. I would only do it if he was right where we were. Right. No worries. Let's just keep running. Yeah. In! Out of light. Out of the way. Okay.

Insight,"re-lock the door or something? Probably not, but I can try. Okay, we'll just shut it and hope they don't notice that we came up here. Let's go. Okay. You all dart inside. At this point, as you are stepping inside, you see on the opposite end, rushing up the edge, you see Jamedi go, ""(huffing) Very good,"" and he jumps inside with the rest of you. Where's Avantika?

Investigation,"Goggles. You're now standing in a small, five-foot by eight-foot chamber. You are all cramped in there, but there is a spiral staircase that leads down. Time to go. One at a time.

Within this chamber, there are clusters of these bits of mossy plant life that's growing in elements of the corners. There is a fountain that sits atop the central platform in the center of the chamber. The water itself is slowly trickling off the sides in small little grooves  it looks to be brackish and green.

That's the most of what you can make out in the chamber. The pillars appear to be more load-bearing and designed-- as you get a closer look, make a perception check on this one. 20. Interesting point. The stonework and the construct of this entire temple is very old and very simple, but you see a lot of intricate carvings and additional stone that's been added to the interior of the chamber that is all carved to represent snake creatures surmounting, and a great",snake god. Make a religion check.
Persuasion,"going to start touching one of the other priestesses and I'm going to start the process. With that, parts of their wounds begin to split open wider as you see bits of reddish-orange fungus begin to find its way out. It looks like a sponge emerging from it. Don't mind that. She turns to you and goes, ""Are you to let me live?"" I think that all depends on your cooperation. We're trying to find our way further below. You can either help expedite that or complicate that.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"Are they gone yet? Doesn't seem very helpful. Ah, I was here the whole time! I'm going to start poking around some of this. Is this attached to the walls? Wait a moment. Nott, have a look around this room. Do you see anything problematic? Good idea! I'll go check the fountain. What are these big fancy-- are these doors on the sides? Those are some of the inscripted carvings that were placed over the existing stonework of the chamber. I'm going to search the body of the beast guy.",MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check as you're
Arcana,"I hate water. You do notice there are, on four edges of the bottom basin at the lip of the water-- and the water meets the very edge-- there are slight grooves where the water's slowly trickling out and down to the floor, and where it hits the floor there is no pool of water. You inspect closer, and there is a hole beneath each groove where the water itself is pouring through the floor below you to what you assume to be a chamber below. This shit opens up! Ja. Is there anything arcane in nature to the writing on the sides of it, or can I ascertain the purpose of it? This fountain.",MATT: Make an arcana check to see if you can
Perception,"Tune into All Work, No Play this Friday! Where the moss is growing, there is a hole in the stone chamber about that big around that looks to be a tunnel or tube that slowly descends downward. Trash chute. Upon glancing at it, the interior is somewhat damp with condensation and that's where a lot of this moss is gathering around the outskirts of it. You also notice scales, little clusters of scales that are gathered on the edges of the stone. Ooh, snakes come in and out of here! Directly above the fountain there's a ceiling, I take it, yes?",MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.
Medicine,"that are in the stonework above. Bits of the stone have fallen and cracked a little. Where those two holes are, glancing directly below them looking up, you can see the faint pinhole bits of light from the sky above. You also see the stone right around those holes is faintly stained crimson. Directly above the fountain. That was the sacrifice tablet on top. Yeah. Oh, that's why it's all grimy. It's blood water. Ugh! Is there sign of blood in or around the fountain or in any of the grooves? I'm seeing if the blood makes it all the way down here.",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Investigation,"to find its way into the fountain, either it's not human crimson color enough. You don't see any signs of it currently in here. Most of the water that's in this fountain right now seems to be just water and algae and grime that has built up within the fountain. Does it look like those vacuous eye holes in the snakes are about the same size as those rubies that I had found? Approximately. Can I just-- Wait! --look for traps? Can I just look for traps around the fountain without touching the water?",MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.
Nature,"Me? Yeah, don't you like doing things with chemicals? Sure, I can, but that seems like more of a medical thing. I'm going to try to get the poison off of it. Off the fangs. Okay. Do you have the materials to do so? I've got a vial. Do you have a medical kit? Have you ever milked a dead snake for its venom? I haven't milked this kind of-- no, I haven't milked a snake.",MATT: Make a nature check for me.
Perception,"Have you ever milked a dead snake for its venom? I haven't milked this kind of-- no, I haven't milked a snake. Make a nature check for me. 15! Okay, you'll spend the next 15 or 20 minutes or so attempting to do this and I'll come to you in a minute with your success and/or failure. Anywhere where there's moss, am I finding these matching holes? You go around finding each of these patches? Yes, there are. At each corner of the chamber there are these patches, and at each corner you do",see one of these holes. Make a perception check.
Perception,"could burn the flesh and it would fuse. Wow! Oh god. We need to chop-- Yasha, chop off all their arms. (as Yasha) No. Jester, chop off all their arms. Well, how about I just drag the bodies over. I start dragging the body over and shoving an arm in the hole. Okay. I'm pushing them. To which one, one of the purebloods? Yeah.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"Yeah. Make a perception check. Oh no. Nice. 20. Okay. As you're dragging it over, you do see a bit of metal jewelry fall out from underneath the robe. Yoink! It is an intricate stone key that is on a metal chain. We should get these of the other ladies. Let's definitely check those bodies. We check the other bodies.",MATT: Investigation check.
Investigation,"Anybody looking at us as I turn around? Jester. (pained) Ah, ah! Your short rest comes to a close. You've used your hit dice, you've healed up a bit, you've gotten your arcane-- Arcane recovery. Cool. What would you guys like to do? I would love to take a last look at the snake iconography and the bits that have been added to see how well-- I don't want to fudge them or anything, but where's there a keyhole? Are these things attached to the wall? What's the deal?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Medicine,bestowing the blessing and mutating followers that are rising up. His army of snake people. Are they any seams or visible machinery or cogs or anything? There are the holes in the ground at the base of the fountain where the waters is actually trickling through to something beneath. There's the curled snakes that are in the water below. Those are the only things that you've noticed around the fountain. I don't think we want the water to go into the ground. Can I try looking at Beau? Check her out and see if I can see what's wrong with her?,MATT: Make a medicine check.
Perception,"little nip of something? He turns back towards you with a curious glance and says-- It's really good. ""I'm sober."" I have some jerky. Do you want a little nibble? You do eat food, don't you? His eyes narrow. ""Yes, I would love some jerky."" Here. Coveted jerky. He takes it from you. ""I appreciate the offer."" He eats and continues to look over-- Is he swallowing?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"It's a blood orange orchard. You can do better than that. What do you do? Could you send some light down there, Caleb? I could do that. Do we want to do that? What's down there? Can we throw a little light down there to see if anything tries to bite at it? Eh, let me borrow this. Frumpkin flies just down to the fountain. Okay. (flittering) I want to see, if I bamf into Frumpkin, if I can hear anything below.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Acrobatics,"the area. You can see these slightly green- to yellow-colored fruit that are bared by these various trees, a lot of which have fallen and are beginning to ferment on the ground and rot. That's where you get the smell that hit you originally. Some of them that have fallen begin to just slowly rot away and decompose into the floor of this orchard. I love me some rotten fruit. Did you say how far to the bottom it seemed? About 40 feet from where you are. About 30 feet once you hit the stairs. All right, I'll jump down to the platform.","MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check for me."
Acrobatics,"tang aftertaste to it. I'll just eat one. Iron-y! Okay, you eat it. What are you guys doing? Well, Fjord is nudging at Caleb-- It's clear, come on down! Fuck! He's looking! He's finger flipping! He's checking his Twitter. He's fine. It's just fun to fuck with you guys. Uh-huh. In answer to your quiet question, I could take the silver thread out and-- I jump down, too.",MATT: Make an acrobatics check.
Acrobatics,"I could have helped, okay. Everybody's doing things too quickly. That thread will take me ten minutes. You catch yourself there, but keep yourself up and begin to descend down the steps and below. I was going to have Caleb put the silver string at the entrance so we'd know if somebody came in. That's ten minutes if we want to take it. It's locked and we have the key. How did we get in? We picked the lock. We'll be fine. I jump down.","MATT: Okay, Beau, acrobatics check."
Athletics,"Okay, Beau, acrobatics check. Jump just down the 40 feet? No, to the staircase. It's a ten-foot fall. 14. You hit it and your foot hits a slick spot. You catch yourself and hold onto the edge, adjust, and then continue down without issue. Oh god, 14 is like the-- It's pretty high, considering. You two are down, the two of you? Mm-hmm. You're up at the top of the tower? No, she jumped already. It's you, Caduceus, and Fjord, I think.",TALIESIN: I'm making an athletics check. Ten.
Perception,"His hair's purple, now it's pink, now it's orange, now it's purple. Oh no! Oh shit. What is happening? Your eyes are like big black saucers. His pupils are purely dilated. Your eyes are normally like tea saucers, but now they're like full plates. Are you all right? (giggling) As you're glancing around, the light orbs that are slowly drifting, they're leaving trails behind. Oh, yes. You should try some of this fruit, guys.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"This entire chamber is roughly 70-ish feet by about 50 feet in size. This orchard, these trees are everywhere. Five-sided still? No, this chamber is four-sided, actually. It seems-- make an intelligence check, actually. Natural 20. Based on the shape of the temple as you saw it, the size of the chamber you were just in, and the chamber below, there should be more space on the sides and the front of it. It looks like this is probably a central chamber of this floor. It's 50 by 70. Do we see any movement in here?",MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.
Investigation,"faint light. Looking across the ground as you look up towards the leaves in these trees, the coloration's not green, necessarily. It's more of a deep purplish brown color to the leaves. Creepy. What's our footing like? Stone, roots, wet? Currently, it looks to be soft earth, and where are the roots and various vines that have entwined their way around from other plant life that have been subsisting off of the ecosystem that's built in this space. What about entrances and exits? You can certainly go check. Make an",investigation check.
Investigation,"now, and we've already seen that these people hunt, so clearly this fruit isn't their main food supply. They like to get high! Is there any signs of animal life in here? Is it any more complex of an ecosystem? I feel like I'm missing something. You don't see any signs of animals. You don't see bits of droppings or claw marks or teeth marks on any of the nearby trees at all. I'm assuming it's for rituals. You're looking for? Entrances, exits, stonework, writing. I think you said investigation?","MATT: Investigation check, because at an immediate"
Perception,"an hour. If I put my hand-- oh wait, no it hasn't. No, It's been more than an hour. I'm going to start casting Comprehend Languages again. I take Nott over to the southern wall. Stop this! I can't take any more! Draw! Draw, Nott, draw! (sobbing) I've seen too much. Should we have been keeping track of which ones were on which wall? I went northern, western, southern. That is right, right? I think that's the right order. I don't understand any of this shit!",MATT: Make a perception check.
Survival,"understand any of this shit! Make a perception check. Seven. Okay. Caleb, do you want to eat some fruit and look at the--? Do you want me to draw what I see? Yeah. Feed me while I'm casting. I think maybe you should draw what you see. Give me ten minutes. That's on the tablets, right? Any tracks in the dirt?",MATT: Make a survival check.
Perception,"Too late, he's already getting high! (laughs) Caleb eats the fruit! He bought the ticket. That would have been probably decent enough to get through that message. Over the next minute or so, Caleb, the colors of the lights begin to shift. You guys watch as Caleb begins to slowly move the floating orbs in different patterns. Gets distracted by his own cantrip. (deep and warped) Caleb, how are you feeling? Hey, I stole this ring from you! Caleb, Caleb, Caleb! Oh, it echoes in here.","MATT: Caleb, make a perception check."
Athletics,"see the vine itself, where it's split open, there's a hardy, thick, light green, tendon-like material beneath. It's a very strong vine. It's wrapped around multiple times around Nott now and it's pulling and trying to squeeze her to death. It's fine. Can I wedge my hand in there to try and give a little bit of breathing room for Nott as I punch the vine? You can either attempt to help her escape or you can attempt to punch the vine. The choice is yours. I'll attempt to help Nott escape. All right. This is your action. It might be a terrible mistake.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Intimidation,"to make a death saving throw. Oh my god! 16? That's a success. All right. Caduceus. I can sometimes influence plants. I'm going to try and get them to stop. You're going to attempt to-- I'm going to try to tell the trees to stop. Okay. What are you saying? We're not here for you. Let go and stop this, or I can't be held responsible for what happens to this place. Do not join the cycle of life and death here.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.

Perception,"Just need to get Nott to higher ground. Caleb is fireman's carry. Got to get Nott on --? To higher ground would be nice. Anywhere where we can see clearly. Quickly! Before this runs out. We need to heal. Heal Nott, heal Nott! I just-- do we know where we're going yet? I think down, but I don't know how to get there. I run over and I pick up Nott and I-- Are we still being attacked by these things?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"The warden garden. The warden. Okay, but hang on. Do we want to go in, like, order, and start with the fountain feeds the garden? Sorry, sorry, sorry, ""the sacrifice feeds the fountain"" at east. All right. There is no tablet or hole in the east. Oh. What about -- South? Yeah, south. ""Fountain feeds the garden."" Okay.

(huffs) I'm going to keep some distance to see if anything snaps at me.",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"Can I get a sense of the sort of animal that would've laid-- This is the south room, right? Yeah, this is the south-- fountain feeds the-- You also see what appears to be a broken humanoid corpse, long decomposed, jammed by one of the clusters. Is he wearing manacles? No, no manacles. Also, can I figure out being in here, do we have any idea how those portholes, those four portholes up above, would feed into this room? You can look around you. Go ahead and make a",perception check.
Perception,"God, these are terrible. 14. You do see, in some of the walls about two feet off the ground similar sized holes that are pushed in against where some of the vines and some of the carvings are that curl upward-- you imagine probably meeting with some of the holes above. You get the sense that perhaps something uses these to traverse up and down parts of this temple. It could be where, once the eggs hatch, they come up, or this is how they get the eggs down, this is a nesting area. All right, what's the west side really quickly? You head to the west one and you go ahead and look inside, I imagine putting the spheres in",as well? Make a perception check.
Perception,"real discerning shapes or details to it, you do see about ten feet ahead of you. It descends into stairs. Ten-foot wide set of stairs. Is there any writing or anything in there? No, but I think it keeps going down. I think they just never quite sealed it up. Seems like a pretty important entrance. I don't know why that would be last on their list. They're not expecting problems, and they don't seem that bright. They're not-- the warden can take care of itself? I guess we'll take a quick look at north just to finish things off?","MATT: Okay. Make another perception check,"
Nature,"They're not-- the warden can take care of itself? I guess we'll take a quick look at north just to finish things off? Okay. Make another perception check, please. Why is everyone yelling? 22. This looks to be a sister hatchery room to the one on the south. This one does not contain a body, but just other clusters of eggs. Is it possible to tell if these eggs might hatch anytime soon, or are they that's left of them?",MATT: Make a nature check.
Investigation,"clutches of-- Is this true? Both look similar, both seem-- Yeah, I'd say so. There's probably no direct danger leaving these things untouched for now. I think we've found a way down there, at the very least. We found our way into the room, though. How big is the entrance into that little, unfinished-- It's the same five-inch tall, 12, 13 inches wide space. Do the tablets look to be on any hinges or levers?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Okay. That's a natural one. You have no idea. Can I try reaching with my hands and pulling? Sure. Make a strength check. No, I'm still big! No, I'm not still big. (humming) No. 12. It's wide enough. The actual stone tablets are maybe about three and a half, four inches long. You can get your fingers through and pull on the other side, but it does not budge. At all. Does it seem like it's separating from the rock, even a little, if I take a look at it from the side?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Acrobatics,"placed against it. You can see, a very very faint gap where they would probably slide either side to side based on some mechanism. Nott, you think you can fit under that gap? Yeah! Course I can! That's a vast cavern down there. Get going. Okay. (laughter) Which one are you going in? Which one are we near? Which one had the stairs going down? The stairwells? It's the western one. Yeah.","MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just to"
Investigation,"There's some carvings, and there's a moving staircase. Did you say moving? I think she said moving staircase, yeah. It's not moving fast, it's just going back and forth. Pressing face against the crack on. Do you see-- Jester wants to know if you see a switch. Like a lever, like a switch, or anything. I'm going to keep trying, see if there's anything that connects to anything. Do you need a globule or an owl? Is there light or any keyholes or any switches or--?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"strongly there, Fjord. I appreciate that. Look, ""this is not me trying to impose my will, just continue the arrangement we made. And I do not ""feel like taking the lead. No. That is not the safest route for the captain, eh?"" Why are you looking at me? Is she invisible? No, she's visible. Oh, okay. Did you eat that fruit yet? I wander over and see if there was a dead body in the other one. Yeah. There's a dead body there. Is there anything missing in the room?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"Somebody's dead. Put the high people in the middle, maybe. Okay, so we'll put Caleb and Nott here. Fjord and Yasha are the tallest. We put them-- perfect. I'll be in the very back. I'll be in front of you, just so we have a cleric on either end. All right, and Avantika is going to stay back with Fjord and Caduceus, and Yasha is going to be right in front of you guys. All righty. Are you descending quietly? Yes?",MATT: I need you all to make a stealth check.
Perception,"Let's not before we fight. We're both right. (laughter) What's the plan? Who's going first? Simultaneous. You're going to float your dupe across the water, and as soon as you say go, your dupe casts? Or go around it, it doesn't have to go across the water. Sure, but your dupe floats. We're assuming that the snake creature's asleep? Or meditating. Does it look like it's got its eyes closed?","MATT: Make a perception check, Jester."
Acrobatics,"I will jump back into the hallway because I'm a coward. All right. Caleb, I think it's a hallucination. Fluffernutter. That finishes Caleb's turn. It is now Yasha, Caduceus and Jester's. I'm going to run out into the room. I want to run out. Can I see both of these creatures? From this position, you cannot. How far would I have to go to see both of them? Hmm, you'd have to get this way and you don't have enough-- you could try and leap off",here. You'd have to make an acrobatics check to
Insight,"That's rough. That finishes Yasha's go. Avantika, it's now her turn to go. Three attacks. Oof, that's not a good round. A two, a three, and 16 on the dagger. That hits, though. Five points of damage for Avantika. Yeah! Avantika! Yeah! Let's get out of this! Shared survival! Jamedi is just going to stare back at you and be like, ""I was not hired for this!"" That brings us to the hydra's turn. You want to reply to that, do you? I'm curious if I buy his bullshit or not.",MATT: Sure. Make an insight check.
Perception,"Oh yeah. Hey, you guy! How come you did not do anything? He glances around and steps down another step. ""I was not paid to do anything of this sort. ""I was a guide. I was to delve. I am not skilled in the ways you are. I'm not stupid to throw myself ""in front of a beast so large."" Worried you could maybe die? It was pretty touch-and-go. Do you want to sit back and stay safe and then get eaten? I am really not myself right now. Yeah. You're being super aggro. It's intense. Is Jamedi wearing any weapons?","MATT: Actually, make a perception check."
Perception,"equipment and materials, in the way he's armored and dressed, is for expediency, lack of sound, and meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy. A lot of browns, grays, and dull greens. He's definitely more of a scout and a tracker, based on his skill set from what you've seen, than any sort of frontline fighter. I want to go over to Avantika. As you approach, she gets up and rummages off the side and pulls off a small lantern she keeps notched on the side of her belt. Do I see anything else tucked up under there while she is doing that that looks of interest or of importance?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Arcana,"We have not explored all of this. ""This is true."" She begins to make her way towards the well at the center of the chamber. I was heading that way myself. Is there any writing of any kind? Glancing about at the pillars, you two can see within the shapes glowing runes that trace from ceiling to floor, then across the ground and all meet at the well. Am I able to read it with the Comprehend Languages that should still be cooking, because it's an hour-long spell? It's not technically a language. These are runes. These are glyphs of some kind. Make an",arcana check.
Investigation,"as you approach, the body lies there, tongue lolling out and drool and blood, a mixture of thick saliva mingling with the dark black-purple blood out of the corner of its mouth, its eyes wide open and rolled back. Its dark, thick green scales of its snake-like head and thick, muscular scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where it was slain. Its blade has clattered to the ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from its form. The rest of its tail coils and is limp off to the side from there. I'll rifle around looking for any keys or objects.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,"I have a few things that I'd like to talk about. Okay, go. Okay, you jump in. First off, Caleb's distraction has given her quite a lead. She's a fairly accomplished swimmer and is making her way down. This well continues on for a good 70, 80 or so feet below. The water is cold. It is salt water. Oh! Salt water? Salt water, not brackish but salt water? Right. You are swimming after her? Mhm.",MATT: Make an athletics check. You have advantage
Athletics,"because the water is-- because of your armor, it's not giving you as much resistance heading south. Athletics? 19. You begin to close the gap slowly, but she's eagerly swimming down with almost a fervor. As you get deeper into this column, this basin below, the walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime like a thick-- It could be a plant matter that's just accrued over the walls, or it could be waste matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly congealed to cover the walls. The stone begins to give way to this dark, slick material. Once you hit about the 70, 80 foot point, the tunnel begins to open like a giant bulb or internal, spherical",chamber.

Athletics,"What's our visibility like? 40, 60? For you, because you have dark vision, you can see within 30 feet of you, essentially. As far as you look the chamber is-- There's not a lot of natural light, right? No. Not at all. It's pitch black down here. That being the case, you don't see the bottom of the chamber, you just see it open-- And just her. And just her, but she's gaining. James Cameron going down to find the Titanic. Just delving straight down into the",darkness. Make another athletics check.
Investigation,"continue to follow, you get probably 40 or so feet from her, but she's still ahead of you. Role again. Natural 20. Natural 20, nice! She rolled okay. You see, now, the bottom begin to approach. In the peripheral of your dark vision, the floor greets to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the same time. You both hit. She looks up at you, and your eyes meet. A few bubbles escape from her mouth and you see her big, wide, toothy grin and she begins scraping grime off the floor. I do the same.",MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"the inside. The pillars themselves still stand, but there are multiple places in this chamber now where these large black cracks now seem to have snaked their way in one instant burst across parts of the wall. They are picking the lock on this safe. The glowing runes blink out. I think the lock's picked. Maybe. They might need three. There's two of three. I'm eyeing Jamedi as I say that. Presumably just two of three. As long as it's just one, maybe Fjord is thinking better of it. I immediately start searching on the ground for another opening.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Athletics,Make an investigation check. Maybe it's not all here. Maybe it's in another location. Maybe there are two other temples. 12. You start pulling through the weeds and the kelp and the grime and-- nothing. It's all smooth stone except for this one little alcove that you found first. Avantika is now swimming frantically up towards the surface. Frantically? Just trying to kick. She lost quite a bit of air. I'll go grab her. You go grab her? Okay.

I'm pointing at the ground.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Perception,"that is lifted up, and there's orchard before you. What do you do? Oh, the orchard, that's right. Were there-- There were stairs up the sides, right? Weren't there spiral stairways? Yeah, there is the fountain, but it has been-- It rose back up to the top when this chamber door was opened. Oh, so there's no stairs? Currently, no. It's raised up and closed off, the front, when you opened the doorway to get deeper into the basement. Can we see to the ceiling of this chamber?","MATT: Make a perception check. With you,"
Investigation,"Right. Hang on. Do I remember which one was the-- I do. Make an intelligence check. Nine. Oh, plus six? No, this is not a saving throw. No, it's just straight bonus. Plus three? So, 12. You recall it was in the chamber where you're standing, and it's not too far from the stairs where you guys descended below. Okay. Do I see a little door, a little hole near where I'm standing? You look over to the side. Make a quick",investigation check.
Acrobatics,"where it is smooth walls before you can actually get to the top floor. Yeah. Cool. We'll get up there and drop a rope. Yeah, I can do that. Let's try that. Let's go.

Acrobatics,"them rapidly. You're now gliding through the street along with the flow of the water, trying to keep above the surface. Caduceus being pushed along by little Nott, going (thudding). At this point, from one of the nearby building tops, you see two of these centurion yuan-ti see you guys pass beneath, begin giving out a call, and then shouting over in their direction pointing towards you. Your presence is now aware to at least a handful of nearby yuan-ti. Their weapons were either lost in the stream or not wielded of course, but they're beginning to pull out their things. You guys continue to ride this forward, you're leading the path, the way you can go. I",need everybody to make a general acrobatics check
Athletics,"that he had set on his map beforehand that had avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle. Between the two of you, you manage to get a fair bit in there, and the sound of the chasing yuan-ti does not seem to be getting louder, which is good. That's one, who does the next offer? I was going to say Yasha can take out the Magician's Judge and start cleaving machete-style through the brush, making it far easier for us to move. Okay, Yasha going to push at the front, which, with a higher speed than you, she can definitely do, and begin to carve through swarths of the jungle to make it an easier passage. For","her, make an athletics check, please."
Deception,"Yeah, rumble of thunder you can do, it has limitations to the sound you can make, but you can make a rumble of thunder. I can't make it the cry of a raven-- ""such as"" is what it says. Oh, ""such as--"" I misunderstood what you're saying. Yeah, there are certain sounds you can make, the sound of a whole group-- I'm making the sound of people rummaging through-- Okay, so rustling in the bushes, it makes sense.

Four of them have shields and spears, and two of them have spears with nets, and the other ones have nets apparently tucked behind their back. They're out here to catch and drag things back.

Two points, your speed is halved. I remember that well. I have the ability to carry a large amount because of my size, can I piggyback and not get too much of a roll if I throw Caleb on my back? I will make this one of your checks. Okay.",MATT: Make an athletics check.
Athletics,"back? I will make this one of your checks. Okay. Make an athletics check. Oh man. You have disadvantage because-- Or you could have Yasha do it.

They're right behind me! You guys look and there are the two rowboats that are still right where you left them. Yasha's moving towards the beach, Caleb's going to just start firing Firebolt after Firebolt at the treeline, I've a 120 foot range, and is going to set the jungle on fire behind us.","MATT: Okay-- I will say, roll an arcana check for"
History,"water surged out of the temple like that. We also heard a large cracking sound as if a lock had been broken or a wall had been broken. You said they were protective in nature? Yeah. So three murals. Three creatures-- beings. Three chosen ones. And three different eyes in each. A creature of the sea, a creature of the air with fire-- And a creature of the earth. Do I remember anything from hitting the books in school of some gods?",MATT: Roll a history check.
Deception,"""His corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful islands and now I have this beautiful reminder."" The hand, you can see, it's now mostly healed over, but there is a scar where this orb once resided in her palm. I'll stand and just pace around the quarters, looking at the various iconography of the serpent. As you're pacing, she talks towards you.

Unless you choose to not wish to. No, I'm not going to stay. You don't walk out of the captain's quarters at sun-up. Plus, I'm super tired. I will leave and try to stealth back to the quarters of everyone else. I have a passive perception of 18. I know. Hopefully you're super asleep.",MATT: Roll a stealth check.

Orly helps show you how he threads this and gets the needle set up. Go ahead and make",a performance check.
Perception,"helps you point it in the direction. Here you see a vessel, a little ways off on the horizon. A little bit north of where you are, a northwestward direction. She whispers over your shoulder so the rest of you can hear. ""Glancing at this ship ahead of us, it appears to be a Concord ship. A shipping vessel probably carrying trade goods. It appears to be equipped for rapid travel, but we could head it off. As my quartermaster, I ask you for your opinion. What should we do?"" Well, I'm sure it's a ship of innocents. We don't want to stray from our path, correct? ""Take a look. What do you see?"" I'll use the spyglass.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"to be? Nope? Boatswain and carpenter? Yeah. I'm a carpenter, Fjord. I'm learning to be a carpenter. Okay, carpenter and-- And a really good tattoo artist. What are you? A boatswain.

Okay. You make out the same details as he does. Nothing catches your attention. Nothing about it seems out of the ordinary per se, but it does seem to be a vessel that is filled with its payload and making its way south. Let me see!",MATT: Make a perception check.
Intimidation,"parlay with your captain and we hope to keep this entire confrontation as bloodless and reasonable as humanly possible. We will do our best to be civil and not encourage anything inappropriate over the next several minutes. We would appreciate your cooperation in this direction. Then I'm going to try and make all the doors open and available to us from the other ship with Thaumaturgy as well. I'm going to pop all their doors open. Soon as that sentence comes to an end, you hear a rapid clattering of heavy wood against wood. It's all of the various ports and doors in the interior of the ship all manage to slam open at once. All the members on the opposite side look",at each other. Make an intimidation check.
Intimidation,"of this ogre. So now you have that. Our friend here is going to play chaperone and ensure everyone stays nice and happy up here. Beau, would you mind coming with me? Yeah, absolutely. Let us know if you need anything. Will do. Again, I must emphasize, no tricky business. We're in good moods. It would be smart to keep it that way. I fire off a Fire Bolt straight up into the sky in an arc over and let it land in the ocean. A Fire Bolt? Yeah, a Fire Bolt. You don't want us to be unhappy.",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Investigation,"Where is the captain's quarters? The captain's quarters is underneath in the back. Be right back. I'm going to go into the captain's quarters. Okay. As you head down, almost everybody who's on the ship is up top. You see a few figures that are deckhands cowering in rooms. They're scared shitless and when you begin walk past you hear (shushing). They're trying to stay quiet. You're in the captain's quarters. What are you doing? I'm looking for any type of important paperwork, correspondence, what these guys are, traveling logs.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"In here? You do not, not within this chamber. All right. I go meet Fjord and Norgul. Nope! Ipess. That's who's with us, I go meet them. Okay. While you're looking, are you waiting for Beau or are you heading out? Yeah, we go together. Beau joins up with you guys. What'd you find? Oh, an entire inventory of the ship. That looks interesting! Oh, yes, indeed it does. Who wants to ask about that? Oh, I believe I will.","MATT: Actually, as high your investigation check"
Intimidation,"I'll point out the ones with the food, some of the water and some of those frozen fruits as well for scurvy needs. ""Okay."" They're all trying to keep a distance from you, scurry down and begin lifting things, at which point a voice below goes, ""What's going on?"" and they go, ""Shh."" They begin to move things back up to the top. I'll grab one of them before they-- I heard that. I crack my knuckles behind Fjord. You know, if you were on the sea long enough, you would know that I'm the type that only asks a question once. Who else is down here?",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Perception,"It's 30-foot. Okay, at the very least, I'm going to get close and walk the-- Oh, yeah. Okay. As you begin to make your way over towards the bow, concentrating on the spell, a tiny little magic source below you, deep in the ship, catches your attention. In the other ship? In the other ship, yes. There's something magic down below. While this is happening-- I say that all the time to my lady friends, by the way. You guys head down into the cargo hold. Super on edge and guarded.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"you try? Yeah, can I give it a better look with my darkvision? No, because you spent your turn helping her. That's right, I'm helping her. Of course. Technically it's both of you looking. Okay, Caduceus aired the fact that he is a little nervous, so I place my hand on Caduceus' shoulder and then look through Frumpkin's eyes to see what's going on. I'm getting a little bit of magic down there, I don't know what it is, but it's making me nervous. Okay. Looking through Frumpkin's eyes, make",a perception check.
Persuasion,"checking in. You're just keeping an eye? Okay. So you're just keeping tabs on the situation. That's exactly what I want to do. I just want to let it known that I'm asking for a volunteer from the other crew. Oh god. I need a volunteer! They all look at each other. It can be anyone, but there should be at least one! The captain steps forward and goes, ""For what?"" For a special present! It's a treat!",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Intimidation,"You can wifi suck HP out of somebody like that? Mm-hmm. Yeah! I just turn to Fjord and go: Frumpkin listens to my commands! That ends Frumpkin's go. Fjord, you're up. I will stand up after having getting the holy fucking shit knocked out of me from those Friend! You better be real sure this is something you want to die for. I would suggest you drop your sword. You're outnumbered. I will take a step back. Nice.",MATT: Make an intimidation check. Because he's

Because he's stunned and beat to shit, I'll give you advantage on it. First one was a 24. Okay, that ends your turn. Yasha's up. Yasha will walk up and attempt to grapple him into a bear hug.","MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for her with"
Insight,"glances over towards a crate that is across from where he was sitting that would still be in his visual perspective. But it's an unsuspecting crate pushed in a cluster of others. He looks in that direction and gives a head nudge. I move to it. Okay. Before I open it, I'll look at him and Is there a trap in this damn thing? Frumpkin lands on his head. ""No."" If you're lying to me, I'll slit your throat. Do I think he's lying?",MATT: Make an insight check.
Deception,"the quartermaster and goes, ""Well done. This will be divvied up appropriately. What else was found? We've got some--"" and then begin to point out the food, the thawing tropical fruit that was placed there. Where's Bouldergut to me? Bouldergut's sitting there with the rest of you, looking around and listening to the captain, looking off into the distance. Maybe ten feet from you. Okay. (stilted) I have to go check on the cannons downstairs. I'll be back later. Wow.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Sleight of Hand,"adhering to this not-killing aspect of piracy. I can tell you from experience, it does not last very long, but I respect the intent. Anything else?"" I heard there were some very good tropical fruits, super rare, in this crate. Based on what I found, (clicks). Good meal later on. Did we keep the sword? I don't remember. We did, yes. I kept a memento. I hold up the longsword. She looks at you, ""Hmm, not bad."" Bouldergut leans in, right over your shoulder, Beau, and goes, ""What's the--"" I slip her 30 gold.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
Perception,"What if she does get the last one? Then we would have failed. Well, at least she would be twice as powerful as Fjord is one. It would be a lot for one person. I mean there's also-- She would want the third. Which is inside of you. Which means she would want Fjord's body. Correct. Can I just take a second and ask Caduceus to check the door? I've been paying very close attention and listening in to the hallway and trying to keep a very--",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Six, seven feet. Just looking out, looking, drawing, I'm very distracted. Just dicks dropping into the ocean. (splashing) (laughter) How far away are you, Jester? I think 15 feet. 15 feet. Not far. Seeing where Jester is, I'll pull Caleb aside. May I ask you a frank question? Of course you can. I scan around for Avantika.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Sleight of Hand,"of the Dragshallow Reefs. Matt? Before you go on, can I just real quickly steal a bunch of gunpowder, while I was learning how to be a powder monkey? You did have days. Okay, you do know that the current master gunner is keeping a very close eye on you after you have exhibited-- I'm talking like a pinch here. Shawshank style? Yeah, little pinches at a time. I don't want tons, I'm not trying to steal a barrel, just enough to make one of those bangy arrows again, just enough for the tip of an arrow.","MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check."
Perception,"the reefs. You can now see the tangled graveyard of destroyed ships and gathered driftwood marking the shallow spots across this jagged cluster of reef. Curving around a southwestern passage, a channel, that opens. The channel beckons you entry as you turn to head northward to what would be the center, the heart of this cluster. No more than maybe 20 minutes into entering this channel, Avantika shouts up at the rest of the crew, ""Raise ""the colors!"" at which point the massive ogre, Bouldergut, tosses the gnomish second mate, Ipess, high up to the central mast, to the crow's nest, where he swaps out the flag to a new one, one that is straight purple.

History,"placed both as a communal barricade on top of the reef, and as a challenge to anything that wishes to come in, but you can see in areas where the rock itself is a little more sturdy and above the surface, there are watchtowers, and there are bolt-throwers and catapults, and there are defenses all across elements of this reef that you imagine are one of the many reasons it's not been taken back by the Clovis Concord in what you would know to be the 40-plus years that Darktow has belonged to what is known as the Revelry. The Revelry? The Revelry is the communal band of pirates that work together to maintain some internal","order. Make a history check, Fjord and anybody"
History,"I'm just scared. Whoops. In the meantime, the rest of the crew seems to have followed suit with Avantika, leaving a few crewmen that are just a part of the docks to keep watch. How guarded or patrolled or monitored are the docks? Pretty damn well patrolled and monitored. This is the bread and butter of their business. In this area, are there uniformed patrols or do you just see well armed-- Muscle is obviously everywhere. You get the sense here, and based on your","history checks, everyone who resides in Darktow is"
Perception,"the edge, you can imagine a few folks have found their end with an odd misstep. The stairs finally stop at a wide stone shelf that overlooks the town at about 200 to 300 feet above, the furthermost edge ending just above the rocky waters of the inlet. A cave mouth greets you against the cliff, warm with firelight. Two watchmen notice you and they stand there keeping an eye as a cloaked man pushes past you to descend from where you came. He just pushes past you. Avantika nods to the guards and shows the chest. The guy that pushes past, what's he look like? What's he wearing? He's a little ways past you now. Make a",perception check.
Perception,"I guess so, we're going to go just enjoy your fine place now, thank you for having us. ""Of course."" Do you have a favorite cocktail at the Bloated Cup? Or a favorite spot. A brew, or-- ""No, I have my drinks brought up here."" Right, course you do. All right, bye. As Avantika leaves, the rest of you are leaving.

Insight,"much this separation and attention that you're the newcomers, and a strange, new shiny thing in their captain's eye. This is the first time you've seen them a little bit three sheets to the wind as a group, and they're talking openly. Avantika has a definite zealotry to her, but you start noticing members of the crew and why they are with her or, at least, now that they've been there, they've also bought into these tales of Uk'otoa. You get the sense that they believe that this path that she's following will lead to her success and, by default, probably their success. How many of them are true believers? Give or take?",MATT: Make an insight check for me.
Deception,"was--? ""Sorris. Sorris Kay. What's your name?"" Oh, I'm Fjord. Nice to meet you. ""Fjord? All right."" Are you a captain, or do you do something else that's more specialized? ""Me?

That's a 14 to hit. Oh, I turn and he hits my shield. Ping! ""Ah!"" I swipe at him with my tail and try to trip him. Go for it. Make another attack roll. 19! Are you just doing damage or are you trying to shove him and knock him prone? Just knock him prone.","MATT: Okay, that's your athletics check,"
Persuasion,"real damage to each other. I'm going to pat his head and cast Cure Wounds. Aww. We're awwing. He's on the edge, finish him! I don't want to knock him out, he's cute. 1st-level.

You're welcome.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
History,"back down at the table. Do divers die there? At this point, Sorris goes, ""Oh, is that where you're going? You're going over to the ""Diver's Grave?"" It would appear so, yeah.

Perception,"tipsy, and I'm going to find myself an evening's ""rest. The rest of the night and tomorrow is yours. Good eve."" Bon soir. Good night. Bye. As she gets up, some of the rest of the crew stands up, you see Bouldergut in the back stand up as soon as the captain stands up, and goes like, ""We going?"" ""Come on, this way."" Walks by, puts her hand on your shoulder, and into your ear, Fjord, as she whispers, she goes, ""I'm staying ""upstairs, second room on the left,"" and leaves. Did any of us see that?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"""upstairs, second room on the left,"" and leaves. Did any of us see that? Make a perception check. (laughter) Oh, that's a bad roll. You see everything, why are you even rolling? 11. It feels pretty public. 15. You've got fucking Mad-Eye Moody's eye where it's on me the whole time and the other one's doing its own thing. Actually, Caduceus, just from his passive","perception, has seen this. What did you roll?"
Perception,"I'm trying to get an image of her in my brain here. Yeah? Did she have like a really good nose or something? The best. Really? For me. You're mysterious, Caleb, you know that? That was a long time ago, anyway. Let's just focus on getting out of this place away from that woman. And now she's saying we all have to take the same boat. How are we going to get away from her? Is there anyone paying attention to us?",MATT: Make a perception check.
History,"materials for sale are left behind. It's mainly just a structure and materials are probably brought there in the morning and are placed out for trade, sell, or whatever. Don't you think it's weird that someone would be a pirate and they would come here because they were a pirate and then they change their mind and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead? No. Maybe they were looking for a new environment and they found exactly what they were looking for. Maybe they thought they were tough and strong, and they were not as tough and strong as they thought, so now they sell rope.",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"Okay. Yasha is doing what as part of this? I think Yasha is probably either with you-- She's either with you or with us, I imagine. Probably with you. She's a bit conspicuous. If things go really bad, she'll be ready to help out on that side of things. If Bouldergut is in the Bloated Cup, that's where Yasha is. There you go. I turn my cloak inside-out to the inconspicuous side, and case towards the docks, and start casing the area for Revelry that are guarding the area, or potentially, a good place for them to do the thing.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"okay. We're ready. Let's do this. While you guys begin to set your ways, Fjord. You make your way to the Bloated Cup. Where do you head? (singing) Thunderstruck! I'll head up the stairs to the second room on the right, was it? (whispering) Left. Second room on the left. Do you want to knock? Anyone in the hallways? At the moment, no. No sign of Bouldergut?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Perception,"ears? (heartbeat) (knocking) There's a slight pause and you hear some rustling and some shuffling. A voice goes, ""Who is it?"" Oh, sorry. Is-- (clears throat) is the captain in? ""Who the fuck is this?"" Fjord. Who's this? ""Piss off, I'm sleeping."" Second door on the-- Is there a door across the hall? There is. I'll put my ear on that one.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"You can, but there's a lack of color. It's mostly some shades of black and white and gray. We should probably figure out a way to light up the room. Are there curtains? There are two sets of small curtains that are currently tied off on the sides of the windows that can open onto the balcony. Do you want to burn them for light? No, we should close them. Oh, okay. That's better. I sneak over and close the windows quietly. Just close the windows. As a general note, I would like you both to",make a stealth check as you go about your activities.
Perception,"I take my cloak off and I put it next to the doorway to block the light. I'll take my cloak and hang it over the curtains so it's double-blocked. Okay, like duvet over the window. I light the candle. I signal to Caleb that they've made it on the ship. I was going to say, once I'm out and about, about once every 30 seconds I will lean on something, pretending like I'm slightly drunk, and I will go into Frumpkin's vision from above, just for five seconds, to look at the activity on the boat and where those guards are, and then go out of it.",MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin. I'll say at
Investigation,"Technically, yes. Now that you have the candlelight there, gently there, quietly. We start searching through her office. What are you looking for? We're looking for anything she's written about where the last fruit tree is, the last temple. You're going through papers, yeah? I'm going through papers. I'm going to go around the walls and look for hidden safes. I'm looking through her desk, seeing if I can find any false bottoms or anything like that to try to find secret information. Okay. Do you want to each make an","investigation check, or do you want to help one or"

There's a small cabinet underneath, and you open it up and there's a series of wooden and metal cups, wine goblets and various types of imbibement containers. Pushing through there, you do find one panel on the back that's a bit loose, and you slide it off and behind there you see a small leather book. I'll check it for traps. Make a-- Investigation? The weird perception/investigation thing for traps, this is the eternal debate back and forth.",Go ahead and consider this a perception check.
Stealth,"That's loud. Okay. All right. In pirate clothes. Sure! Pirate Keg, Pirate Molly. Yeah. The most inconspicuous person. With a cloak over his head! Just a purple tiefling.

Now the screaming is less frantic and more a pained scream while the rest of the various watchers of the dock start making their way over, while you guys are swimming? I'm wet and upset! Why did you do that?! Just away and around. Okay, so you're probably following under the docks. All right. Both of you guys make an",athletics check.

You can ask her if you want, but I don't think you really want to. Pretty sure she's above your pay grade, am I right?",MATT: Make an intimidation check.
Perception,"Sup, guys. How was your night walk? It went very well, I take it. Fjord, you're sitting over and you watch them all talking just outside of the inn. There was a little hiccup. Schmidle of a one. But we took care of it. Shh. Who's around? I mean, there are guards walking-- Do I see a commotion from here? The commotion seems to have died down at the moment. Nothing crazy going on on our ship? I don't see some figures or anything?",MATT: Make a perception check from this distance.

Like, suggest to someone that we were drinking with them all night, in case it's asked? They'll know. Oh, well then don't do that. Never mind. Who's really drunk, though? Is there someone real drunk?

No. You guys at this point have been brought to the docks now, and you're being pushed toward the direction-- You can see the Squalleater there waiting, and there a number of figures already on deck.

We've teamed up with our good friend, Patrick Rothfuss, and his fantastic charity, Worldbuilders, to create a special set of Vox Machina single-use buff cards that can be used for your own home games. I ask all you dungeon masters out there, if one of your players brings one of these to the table, to the best of your ability, please allow the one use the card allows because, if not, you hate charitable things, and you're a terrible person. They paid good money to help good people to use these cards. If your DM won't let you, you let me know. Whoa.",LAURA: Roll an intimidation check.
Persuasion,"Roll an intimidation check. Does the DM get to keep the ticket if you spend it? Is the question. An eight. That's on par for me, I think. Not higher than 15. Not high enough for me. I'm not an intimidating sort. You lead with your heart. Yeah. Persuasion I can do. For an example, we have the Grog card, where a player of any character can rage once during a combat, regardless of their class, as you want to. (as Grog) Yeah, you've got a rage. Or we have the Vex card, allows you a",charisma boost to a persuasion check because you

That was two weeks of tension being released. Orgasms all under the table right now! Holy shit! You watch as the ocean begins to swell upwards.

Acrobatics,"weapons drawn, but in the midst of all this, they see crazy stuff happening and the one person darting at an inhuman speed away from it, and their instinct is to go, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's figure this out."" They're not aggressive yet. That's your turn? Can I say anything? I'd say this happens at the very end of your turn. You're running, running, running, all of a sudden you stop right as they (clanking) right there in front of you. We'll pick that up next turn. Okay. That brings us to Avantika's go. All right.

Anywhere where I can duck and cast Disguise Self really fast? Yes, but you'd have to move up. You probably wouldn't be able to get to an alley to do it this turn. There are people around. There are folks that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance. Okay, then I'm going to shout: Avantika is attacking people on the island! She's trying to upstage the Plank King!

I'll use the rest of my-- yeah I knew that, I'm planning for that, yeah. I'll use the rest of my 30 feet to run towards that unconscious wizard. Okay, so you go heading towards Caleb.

This one here is going to-- He tries to move forward towards Yasha, and ends up chest-bumping space in the middle of the air, and confusedly is going to try and grapple whatever's there.

All right, so first guy-- Do they roll? Do I roll?",MATT: You roll an acrobatics check against them.
Persuasion,"(laughter) That would've been great! That was my next move. Oh, man. All right, that ends. Top of the round. All right, so, Beau. The guards are there in front of you right now. There's three of them shoulder to shoulder, and there's one of them that looks-- the one in the center is a little better-armored. They go, ""Hey, Miss, Miss, where ""are you going?"" They're looking at you and both looking at what's over there. I have requested evidence for the Plank King. He wants to see me directly. It's Avantika. There's a coup. She's trying to take over the city with a demon god.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.

You just hear a lot of shouting, so you're like, ""Oh man, my deception worked, other people are yelling this!"" I go: See? To the guards next to me. Perfect. (nonsensical rabble rousing) That finishes Jester's turn. It's Yasha's go. Yasha is currently grappled, but you can still make her actions.

There's, I believe at this point, four of them that were heading your direction, because there was the one that was going towards Caleb. So we'll say two of them you'll have to push past.

You can see 03:36:04.378 --> 03:36:06.828 two other smaller whales alongside it. 03:36:06.828 --> 03:36:08.731 Aww, baby calves. 03:36:08.731 --> 03:36:16.302 Hey.

Perception,"Dreadnought."" Yeah, I know. Loading the gun against you guys for the game tonight. It'd be pretty funny. Does that mean that Logic was the whale that just passed us by? There you go. Oh my god! We still have Pass Without a Trace up. I just cast it because of that whale. Oh, that's right. Hey, Caduceus. Yeah. You feeling any creepy, spooky, dead people, or crawlies?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Hey, Caduceus. Yeah. You feeling any creepy, spooky, dead people, or crawlies? Make a perception check. Oh, right. That's actually a good idea. I'm also going to-- With disadvantage because there's no light here, and it's a very short range, I'd say. Because you guys extinguished all your lights when the-- That's a natural one. Ooh, starting out right. Woo!",TALIESIN: Perception checks?
Perception,"You know, the ship that started your whole backstory? It's the Tide's Breadth. The Tide's Breadth. (laughter) Your origin story? Yeah, the sheet of paper you turned in nine months ago. I don't think I named it in my backstory! The Tide's Breadth, yes. I am going to summon Frumpkin to my shoulder and look through Frumpkin's eyes because Frumpkin, as an octopus, has darkvision. So I will see that way.",MATT: Perception check with Frumpkin.
Perception,"out, probably during or shortly after the explosion, but before it sank fully. The edges of the cargo hold that are blown open-- as soon as you begin to peer in the inside, you can see the interior is blackened as well, amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it as a home, and bits of seaweed, and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside the empty ship. Ooh. As an idea, sword in my hand, as we start to push in through that hole of the explosion, or peer in, can I lead with the sword and see if the light and/or eye is reacting in any sort of way? Or is it just static?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Nein. As you begin to swim into the darkened interior, holding the sword in front of you, it doesn't seem to react, adjust, or give you any sense that it is able to guide you in any particular direction. In the sea, certain creatures like to make homes of vessels. You want to send in your--? Ja, that's no problem. I give a little tug to the leather tied at my knee and cast Mage Armor. I send Frumpkin in, and reach for Nott, and hold Nott by the shoulder. Look through Frumpkin's eyes and send him in to look. Okay. Frumpkin's octopus form makes his way into the cargo hold of the Tide's Breadth",wreckage. Go ahead and roll a perception check for
Perception,"the familiar quarters of Vandren, though they look tossed. Really? As you look inside, there's the table where he normally sat and read his books. That table is set over  the shelf is pushed over. Looks like most everything in here has been, in some way, shape, or form, tossed. You remember there being all sorts of decorations that he kept in here, metal candle holders. It's all missing. It's all missing. Is there anything that I-- At first glance. Is there anything that I see that is definitely out of place or changed that I remember?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"somebody was definitely fucking looking for something. Do you know if he kept anything in a secret place? Do I? I don't think I do. Because maybe he took it all with him. Maybe he left. Could be. Yeah. I'll go get Caduceus and Caleb. Beau is really good at finding things, I think. I'll go get everybody. I'll keep looking around the room while he-- Okay, you're doing a thorough investigation",of the interior? Roll an investigation check as

While they're looking, I want to point out to everyone that whatever it was that took this ball has claws, and it looks like it could break this thing open. It looks like it might do some damage to us. Is it dented at all, or just scratched? How big a creature does it look like was taking a--?",MATT: Make a nature check.
History,"I think it's safe to assume that that was done after the ship sunk. A hole this size wouldn't keep a vessel in the water very long. No. Do we know anything about underwater creatures that would be interested in, I don't know-- Glowing eyes? Yeah. Jewels? Pretties? Underwater goblins? I mean, there are a number of creatures of folklore and things that are greedy no matter where they live. Locate Ariel. Yeah, mermaids? I don't know.",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"dreams, Fjord. True. Very true. 18. I mean, there was one other time that you encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering and hoarding things that were shiny and happened to be affiliated with underwater existence. Yeah, right. I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer. Do you mind if we go? This is all too strange. Be on guard. Where are you exiting? Fuck it, we'll go back up above deck, and we'll jump off the stern in the direction that Jester--","MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me."
Perception,"No, ein bisschen. You can't hear anything. While we're walking, it's going to be about a ten-minute walk? Is it insane to--? You don't know. Yeah, as we're walking, I'm going to start Prayer of Healing, I guess. I know it takes about ten minutes, but it's a one-spell heal-all. Okay, if you want to. If that's okay. Everybody gets, oh! 17 points back. Whoa! We'll consider that as you guys are traveling. You're helming this journey from that","direction? Make a perception check for me,"
Perception,"No, another ship, sunken, here. You continue on for another 100 or 150 or so feet, and you see the shape off to the right of another shipwreck. (whispering) It's a graveyard. We're definitely in that shit now. The song? Y'all remember the song? The Diver's Grave! Maybe we should go up for supplies. The spell fades, but you still know the general direction of where it was coming from. Up to you if you want to cast it again or continue on based on the memory. Let's continue. Do I see any sources of light?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"Let's continue. Do I see any sources of light? Make a perception check. Can we move stealthily underwater? You can certainly try. You're moving half-speed because of the water, and you're moving at half speed beyond that, moving stealthily. So it's a very slow journey, but you can do it. 11. Okay. Are you guys moving stealthily or not? Yes. It'll be a slow journey, but we can try to move.","MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, and make a"

Perception,"Are you guys staying put or are you continuing to move forward slowly? Ooh, let's take a looky-loo for the moment. You all sit tight for a second, halting your position. You watch as the octopus makes its way into the shadow ahead. Caleb, you're focusing, and it takes a while, but Frumpkin eventually, following this tiny, shifting bead of golden light into view. You begin to see towards the center of where this large valley is. There is a large cluster of long dead, pale-white coral that surrounds a rocky stone shelf. Too real. Fucking awesome.",MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.
Perception,"begin to shift your way forward, using it as a screen. The shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along in the direction of this coral cluster. Can we ribbon dance a little bit as we go? There you go. Just you two, right? Is this the group? No, all of us are doing it. Whoever wants to be stealthy and be a brilliant person, I guess. I just wrap some seaweed around Caleb. Okay. Who's at the front of this journey? Maintaining a similar position? I will be.","MATT: Okay. Perception check, and one other person"
Perception,"As you move up to the edge of the shelf, and you glance over the edge, you see the shadow entrance of the cavern before you. Once again that shimmer finds its way across a dozen or more coins that are visible, partially embedded in the muck and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance. Should I try to send my duplicate down? One question. This is definitely coral that we are sitting on top of, right? It's bits of coral. When you step out towards that shelf, the coral recedes and now it's a protruding large slab of stone. It is a protruding large slab of stone and not a big-ass mouth or anything like that, right?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"30 seconds pass of Jester doing the song and dance down there. No reaction. Shit. It might need actual vibrations or-- No, there's nothing down there. I'll jump down there and join Jester. Okay. Fjord dives off the side and swims down towards the entrance to this cavern. As you approach you can see the coins plainly in front of you. Do you land at the entrance? Mm-hmm. Okay. Your feet find soft footfall on the sediment that has gathered there, knocking up a little bit of it for a minute before it all eventually settles once more. Looking inside, make",a perception check.
Investigation,"As you step in the inside, it descends a bit, like makeshift natural paths, like stairs or grades that curve around and drop into the central chamber where you see it goes in two different directions, to the right and left. In the middle, there's a large cluster of this purplish-maroon seaweed. The outside of the leaves have a teal-ish blue color. It wraps up against the walls as well. As you swim through and move, the still water shifts with your movement  you can see some of it sway and move with your movement. Oh fucking Jesus, our stealth is going to be balls here. What does the floor look like? Sand, silt, coins?","MATT: Looking down, make an investigation check."
Perception,"No, let's just do it. Let's do it. Fuck it, right? We're all going to die down here anyway, it doesn't matter. Don't you think there might be something in the middle of all the kelp though? There might be, but we'll keep an eye on it as we move around to the right  I just have a very strong feeling about going to the right. It's based off of, really, gut-- I'm right handed, so we're going to go to the right. Let's do it. All right. Do we see bubbles in the water at all?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"You are not poisoned. You just took poison damage. You manage to pull it away and catch up with the rest of the crew. You guys are heading towards the right chamber, which begins to rise up a bit before leveling off about 15 feet above and about 20 feet ahead of you. The walls are still covered in this seaweed in chunks. About every five or so feet, you see another cluster, and they're a bit scattered around the interior. A large portion of this whole chamber network seems to be housing this same type of plant. We're going to move fast, and I'm going to keep Eldritch Blast charged, and if anything starts to reach closer than other areas of it.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Resistance on you. Well I'm just going to give you-- if anything happens in the next minute you can add a d4 to any saving throw. Okay. Following the tunnel down for another 15 to 20 or so feet it curves around to the left. Do you continue and curve around the edge? Mm-hmm. You come around the corner and look. You guys are at the front. I need Jester and Fjord to make-- since you have the globes, you can move the globes ahead if you want to. I'll say that they're 20 feet ahead of us and 20 feet behind.

She just-- actually no, she shoulder checks the seaweed and does not give a shit. It works for Yasha. (as Yasha) No problem. You guys all begin to push forward. This chamber is larger than what you came in through. It's about 50 to 60-foot diameter, continues in for about 80 or so feet, and the height goes to about 30 to 35 feet. All the walls here are","covered in this seaweed. Make a perception check,"
Arcana,"just past the edge, you do not detect anything particularly magical. Then as you take your first step into the chamber, you see this. You almost run into it. In the middle of this chamber, there is a small two-foot pedestal and a disc, a stone disc about that wide and about two feet from edge to edge that is resting on it but at an angle. It looks old. It looks weathered and there appears to be a spiral of runes, two sets of them, that curve inward around each other before merging in the center with one singular sigil where they meet. Are these arcane glyphs, or is this language? They are arcane glyphs. If you'd like to","make an arcana check, if you want to take a moment"
Perception,"it. Beginning of this round. The only person that's seen this entity is Caduceus. I can't see them anymore? No. They seem to have shifted into this thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around all the walls of this chamber. Beau, you're up first. I don't see anything. I look around? You can use your action to try and perceive if you want to. I go: Caduceus! Then I look around and see if I see anything. Okay, so you use the search action. Roll a",perception check.
Athletics,"You still don't see her. I don't see her! That's it. All right, that ends your turn. Yasha? Can you hold until you--? He used action, movement, and bonus. Who's up? It is now Yasha. Oh, right, that's me. Fuck. Cad's still grappled. Help. Oh yeah. She'll go through and take some swipes at the kelp, trying to loosen Caduceus. Or would it be better to grab you and fucking pull? If she rages in advance, she can use",advantage on the athletics check. Up to you.
Investigation,"Oh, that's right, you're-- Yeah, wow. You guys all cleared that check. Nice. Fuck you, ghost. Lair action, no effect. All right. Sorry, Matt. No, don't apologize.

Yeah.",MATT: Make an investigation check for me. I'll say
Arcana,"falling a bit behind. Actually, no, you can do all three with your bonus action. Well, you both can, just in case you want to spend ki points. Nah, not now. I have a question to you, when you've done that. Yes? Back in the chamber, Detect Magic is still up. Does Caleb see anything with an arcane glow in this room other than what Fjord picked up? Only the aura from the table. So none of the shit around the edges, okay. I guess I will start studying the runes on the walls to see how they contribute to this mystery.","MATT: Okay, make an arcana check."
Perception,"I am basically holding ready to shoot a bolt at anything that moves, and I was actually hanging a little bit far down just in case one of them drops, I can heal, and somewhere where I'm not going to get attacked by kelp and I'm keeping very aware. Okay. Well, you were staying over in this chamber with them. Nott and Beau, you are in the central chamber now. Do you want to search for the possible whereabouts of Dashilla? I want to look around and then I want to head towards that alcove back there. I'm following to make sure she's okay. I technically haven't heard shit.",MATT: Both of you make perception checks.
Perception,"Wrapping up in here. As you come around the corner, you see an old, decomposing pile of merrow corpses similar to the ones that were tied up inside, but these all have these wounds of their throats slit from side to side. Oh, sacrifice style. They're all in various states of decomposition, the freshest one maybe months ago, and the sea has caused its own unique form of bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of the skeleton. Gross. Is she in here? Do we see any movement?",MATT: You can make another perception check.
Perception,"I will fire at this ghost. Go for it. Not great, 12-- no, 14. 14 hits, roll damage. It is adjacent to Beau so you get sneak attack on the ghost. That's really good. Jesus. 29. It dissipates. You watch as its glow vanishes. This horrible low, dull, vibrating sigh slowly goes away and it's no more and he's immaterial. You punched that ghost really well.

As you place your hand down on it, you see this dull red glow around the hand that's placed on the table. As you begin to pull your hand up and look, the runes where the blood has splattered have begun to give a faint glow. Mm-hmm. Has anything changed with the ones on the walls?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Cut palm to cut palm. (whispering) Blood brothers, so cool. I'll start to head out of the chamber. I follow Fjord out. Nott and I meet the rest of them. I'm going to try to get as much platinum and stuff as I can before I walk out.",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"""think we better should."" I didn't like it either, Yasha. Her brow tenses and she follows you out. As you all converge towards the central chamber once more-- The guards are floating, following us. As you're walking, some of the seaweed reaches out and the unicorns (fizzle). It lasts for ten minutes, right? As you approach they eventually flitter out. You all gather there at the entrance. Are we out of the cavern now? Are you all backing out of the cavern?

Investigation,"Instant death. Yes, make a saving throw. (gasping) I take my sphere. (laughter) That's my next character. Kiss of death. Thank you. Thank you for letting me play with your cat.

History,"It's a name. Yep. Halas. What is it? Halas. H-A-L-A-S. Well, we have just robbed Halas. Have any of us heard that name before? (disagreement) Mm-mm. Do we know what language that name hails from? It seems to have some roots in Zemnian, but it's a divergent element, so a name that hasn't been used in a long, long time. Kind of like-- Archibald, or-- Yeah, like Melchor. Things that are old","historical names. In fact, roll a history check."
History,"As it looks right now, you need to shift it back to use a previous function. Each thing you slide unlocks the next use, but it closes off the previous one until you reverse it. Which I am memorizing. I go to Fjord. You've told us about the Halas thing? Yeah, sure. Is this perhaps something to do with Sir Cadigan and Port Damali stuff? Do you know a Cadigan? Would I recognize the name Hadigas? You wouldn't. Cadigan. No, Halas.","MATT: Oh, Halas? You roll a history check, too."

If they did teach it, you probably weren't paying attention that day at the Archive, unfortunately. Would I know it in relation to Sir Cadigan, the person I took it from?",MATT: Roll a history check.
Investigation,"Oh no. I cast Mage Armor. All four symbols are the same on all four banners? Mm-hmm. It was Hala? Halas. Exits? Do we see any exits? No. Pedestals, are there anything on them? There are four pillars. They are smooth. They appear to be either decorative or load-bearing, but there is nothing about them that catches your eye.

It burns solid for a good 30 seconds. Surrounded by flame, all of you are being lit by this. You're wincing from the heat you feel you should be feeling, but it's all being held at bay by the hut's boundaries. Eventually, the flames die out, the door, tapestry both untouched. I pull the hand back to me, and I take my keys, ow! Back in my pouch. Yeah, they're very hot. Can I search the pockets of the red coat?",MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"one? It triggered something, but you feel confident. I'll send the hand back out to try the handle again. (click, door creaking) It opens up. You've got to follow through. Sorry guys, I'm a little absent-minded. I mean, there's a lot going on right now. We have a way out! Should we just go out, then? I'm going to double-check these bodies for things before we go. If anyone wants to help",me with an investigation check--
Medicine,"picked clean. In fact, you find the belt on one of them seems to have been broken forcefully, and a couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where a belt pouch may have been resting for a while. Missing. Somebody has completely rolled these corpses and picked them clean already. Sorry, buddy. Seems that they were robbed before they came in here. It's weird. Or while they were in here. Oh, that's even crazier. Is there a way to tell if they were robbed post-mortem or pre-mortem? I don't know! How do you tell that?",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Perception,"don't want us anymore. Oh my god! It's possible. Let's kill her. Well... When the moment is right. Okay, okay. (laughter) So what are you guys doing? I am placing Frumpkin outside of the bubble. He always sends Frumpkin in to die. I am going to go look in the next room. But I love that cat!","MATT: Okay, roll a perception check for Frumpkin."
Stealth,"and LAURA: We're fine. We're fine, Fjord. Everything's fine. Don't worry about us. They just turn on you that fast. I don't-- I think-- We'll talk later. Okay. Caleb says nothing. Nope. In fact, Twiggy's not even really going to wait. She starts to chase the cat. She wants to go see the cat and pet the cat. Okay, so Twiggy leaves the radius and starts heading towards the far end of the room. I'm going to sneakily do it, though.","MATT: All right, roll a stealth check."
Perception,"As Caduceus steps in with the staff, the light seems to be crushed down to where you can see the faint bit of it there, but there's something about this hallway that's swallowing the light or at least compressing it to where it's not giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it. That's weird. Do we press ahead? I mean. No other way to go. Can you see anything, Beau? That's what I was going to ask.

Perception,"Meaning the end of this doorway, whatever's at the other end, is being tethered by something that's not really material space. You don't know what distance you're traveling between these two objects. Okay, I relay this to the group. We jumped dimensions to get here, and whatever is laying before is not a hallway. In a way it is, but not the traditional sense. But it might even be the way back out. It might be, yeah. As we turn around and look at the door that we came back through, are there any markings above the door or around it?",MATT: Perception check.
Perception,"We're not in there yet. The flames we see are between us. The flames you see are inside the chamber, and you haven't entered the chamber yet. The Thaumaturgy doesn't seem to-- But are they in the way of us entering the chamber? No. Oh, okay. No, I was just curious if the magic would follow through, apparently not, or whatever is in there is not real. I don't know. Can we see any movement outside the flames?",MATT: Make a perception check.

Yeah, to like enter this door.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Stealth,"it, but there's nothing behind, no daylight to really make it clear from this distance. You'd have to get closer. Do we see any other exits in this tower, this chamber? Not from where you're standing. But you guys still have not entered the chamber. Should we do it stealthily? Yes. I think we're about to enter into someone's study.

I'm going to try the candelabra again see if I can get those flames a little brighter. Once you start, all of the flames flicker brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber. I'll reel them back in. All right, that's good to know. You say now we see a door and it's open? That's the door you came through. But there's no other doors in this room?",MATT: Make a perception check. You guys entered
Arcana,"While that's happening, the stained glass window, now that you have light that's illuminating it-- Oh shit. There is no backlight, so it's just the light that you have on it right there.

You see different colored discs, different sizes and colorations, that are laid into this with fragments of dark blues and grays in between.

There's the second book and the third book. Okay, second book? 21. That book, the metal brace opens up, and the book is available to you. Hey, Caleb! Caleb, we got books! Are there any sigils or writing anywhere on the frame of the window or in the window?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"anything besides decor and a library? Did anybody see what he was doing when he disappeared? Yeah, he was looking in this area. He was like, ""Ah"", and then I feel like I saw his head go over here. But then the bookshelf was in the way, so I couldn't see what he was reaching for. Did anyone check this desk over here, next to the portrait? That's what Caleb checked earlier. What about the far desk, behind the mimic? No one's looked at that, necessarily.

If you're helping him out, yeah. Roll again. 13. It's hard to say. It's definitely a very pretty book. It's trying to get your attention by the way it's designed and placed. Doesn't look like it's dangerous. Looks safe.","MATT: Make a perception check, Caleb."
Investigation,"Has spell equations in it? Okay. We have to get Fjord out of that window somehow. Take the book! At least take the book! Hey, I've got an idea. I don't know how much time we have, and yes, we've got to find Fjord-- I'll touch that book. Touch the one that's open? Okay. You touch it. It's a regular book. Caleb, do we have her Happy Fun Ball? No. It's gone? It didn't come with us. Do you have your haversack?","MATT: Make an investigation check, Beau. Since"
Acrobatics,"I'll move this out of the way. We could have done the ruby book! I came to destroy your party. It was a red herring. That was a trap. Or it could've been the spell book that answered all your problems. So Fjord. The sensation of being rapidly thrust through darkness at a breakneck speed is tough on you for the moment that it's there. Your sense of physicality is stretched for just an instant, infinitely.

Investigation,"fucked up. All those teenagers in hoodies are going like-- It was pretty gnarly. Well, I'm glad you guys are safe, for whatever the fuck it's worth. It's worth a lot, and probably we'll be a little more careful about poking things separately. I was testing the texture. It wasn't even a push  I just touched it. No, it's the buddy system.

That looked like it hurt. Do you want to be healed? Maybe? A little lower than I thought I would be. Can I try to grapple again and try to get my sword back?

It's at a slight angle, yeah. Travis, how are you going to handle the shaft? I'd like to spiral down, slowly making my way around the top so I can see. Okay.

It is not similar, from what you can tell, to what you encountered at Dashilla's lair in the Diver's Grave. You're not certain if it has any interest in you guys, but it doesn't seem to be reacting to your presence. It doesn't seem to be a problem. We're just going to be here for a minute, and then we'll be on our way. Let me know if you've got any issue, and we'll do our best to stay out of your business.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Perception,"cool! That's old business. We've seen that one. As you guys take a short rest, you can use your hit dice to heal up. We'll be inside. Are you doing your thing? No? No, if we're taking a short rest. That's if you don't want a short rest, but you want to roll out. Copy. While we're around down here, can I swim around, look for any other trap doors, or doors, or doors?",MATT: Sure. Make a perception check at first.
Investigation,"one. As you guys take a short rest, you can use your hit dice to heal up. We'll be inside. Are you doing your thing? No? No, if we're taking a short rest. That's if you don't want a short rest, but you want to roll out. Copy. While we're around down here, can I swim around, look for any other trap doors, or doors, or doors? Sure. Make a perception check at first. Perception. Four.",MATT: Okay. Then make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Careful as you head out there. You don't know what's above you. He cares about you. The tendrils that are from its head that you saw trailing behind it are as long as the length of its body. There's about 12 of them that drift behind it, though they're all limp now, and it just lies there, destroyed. It's wearing an old, slightly tattered robe, who knows how ancient. That's as much detail as you can make off of it, other than its jaws limply hanging open, these dull lifeless flaps where you can see the toothy interior of its mouth as it hangs. Does its busted-up robe have pockets?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"But Yasha's really strong. Sure, but so are you, and you could show him-- Okay. I don't mind. Go on, have fun, take your time. All right? Do you need any money? No, I'm okay right now. Thanks, Mom. This is the body  this is what I was talking about with the tendrils, with the hair and stuff. It's pretty gross. Is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff on it? Keys?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"You glance and look inside, and you appear to be in some sort of a spherical chamber, roughly about 60 feet across, side to side. And I'm at the top of it, right? You're at the top of it, looking down. There are clusters of seaweed. All around it, there's plant life that's embedded in aspects of it. A bunch of the seaweed is all coming up and tangling towards the center to create this upward column of plant matter. That's where the roots were, and it was growing up through the tunnel or something? Oof. I don't see any signs of life or light or structures?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"and died. I have the second and the third, but that's my logic. I must concede, I don't know how many temples there are. I'm only going off of that art that we saw in the temple. There were three in the art, and there were three balls, and you got the two balls. This is ball three? Ball two. Now, unless there's two holes in here. There should only be one, in theory. I'm taking a long look around during this. Ball two? Wait. You have two in you. Are you looking in the space? Make a",perception check.
Investigation,"temple somewhere, with another person with dreams like you and Avantika, who has already done this? This could be the final piece of the puzzle, if we understand the carvings we saw correctly, even. We don't actually know, do we? No. Could you ask your god? Could you ask him? How do I do that, Jester? Well, do it like I do to the Traveler-- Does he answer you when you talk to him? Yeah. He does? I'm going to start looking around. Hey, Traveler!",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"I will need some time. I heard you whispering about this bauble, so I will begin on it. Well, the glass sphere makes me nervous. I feel like I heard of things like this before. Well, if someone has seen us through it, they already have. My question to you-- oh. They could see us through the glass sphere? In theory. I sat down on the floor-- oh shoot. I cannot do it now because my books are in your bag. If I take them out, they would be ruined. Yeah, I haven't opened it. Don't worry. That's okay. We can do it on the ship.","With that crazy investigation check of yours, did"
Investigation,"With that crazy investigation check of yours, did you find any recessions in the floor? Yeah. Just one? Yeah. Can I get a closer look at the skeleton with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable? The armor is studded leather. It's well made. There's a bunch of black sediment and general slime and grime from the red plant life that's gathered around the various plates of it that are fastened together, but it rubs off relatively easily. It's well made. No iconography? No identifying symbols?",MATT: Make an investigation check for me.
Medicine,"outside, on the inside of the shoulder and the back of the plate, you can see faintly pressed runes. Yeah! Magic armor! Too clean to be normal. I don't recognize that armor, do I? Not really. I'm going to point out, I'd be careful. Whatever this armor is, it didn't seem to help this fellow much. That's a good point. What do you think killed him? Does he look like his appendages are all attached? Any cracks on the skull or face or any sort of--",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Perception,"Yeah. All right. Making that route-- you're giving the direction-- the sails pick up and the ship begins moving. As the ship turns around the corner and you're glancing as it makes its way in your direction, no colors flying. Similar size, if a little bit smaller than your ship. As a first mate... Correct. Do I get a dope first mate kit, like a spyglass? There is a spyglass on board, as part of the equipment. Can I use the spyglass?",MATT: You may. Make a perception check with
Survival,"and hit them with our starboard cannons. Get around that little piece of... No, we're still out of range. We've only got three cannons on the starboard side, though, if we turn to port side-- We're still out of range by 300, 400 yards. I can't do anything until they're 300 feet away anyway. Sure, yeah, let's aim to hug the coast on the starboard side. Okay. As you guys maneuver and tend to hang in close, making your way in towards the island, they do gain a little bit of distance. I need you",to make a survival check as you are currently
Survival,"feet away anyway. Sure, yeah, let's aim to hug the coast on the starboard side. Okay. As you guys maneuver and tend to hang in close, making your way in towards the island, they do gain a little bit of distance. I need you to make a survival check as you are currently leading the ship to try and avoid any sort of heavy rocks and things along the side of the island. That is a three. Because I would be doing this as well, can I give advantage to that, or can I roll as well on that? No, he has to roll on that. He's the captain, unfortunately, yeah.","TRAVIS: Negative two to survival checks, y'all."
Perception,"a second wind! Nah. (laughter) I want to kill things with my cannons! You're not shooting that great anyway. I think probably this was for the best. You can see shards of wood all scattered in the area around it, and the boat is sinking. Between the impact of being capsized by the wave, the blast of the cannon fire, and the fact that you're so close to the edge of the island put it in a position where it can't right itself. What do we see in the way of survivors swimming about?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"don't know specifically, but there does not appear ""to be a manhunt. Just be careful."" My momma says everything's okay! We just got to be careful. I think that's the plan. Caleb, you want to take time to Identify your goodies? I certainly do. I hand Caleb the leather armor as well. Thank you, Beauregard. Mm-hmm. I will go back to Nott and my quarters, and pull out the book, and take less than an hour to-- there's five things now. Okay. Yeah, because you rolled really high",on that investigation check. What are the five things?
History,"have. Oh, yeah, that. I'd love to see about getting this fixed, maybe, as a token of appreciation for Mr. Fjord for doing such a good job taking care of himself on his own quest and not getting sidelined into some bad thoughts. That is very thoughtful of you. Thank you! I also don't know how to find a blacksmith. Oh, I think I know a pretty good one! Okay. Access the memory banks. (warbling)","MATT: You can make a history check. As you,"
History,"What do you do with it? Wait, I left it at the blacksmith. Oh, we're getting so afar. You just mimed a metal box. I did, yeah. That's amazing. You're very talented. Let's go ask around for a blacksmith. I think Caleb had something to say. Jester. Yeah? What about a place that has writing materials? Paper and ink and that sort of thing? Oh, yeah, my mom was big on books. There's a joke in there.",MATT: Make a history check.
Perception,"see Tyral, the young man who had helped you with your cart, but does not recognize any of you, really. Nods as you walk into the establishment. It's still early enough where the clientele-- there is no presentation. It is mainly a relatively quiet midday dining experience. There are maybe three people in the interior, and they're probably having business meetings. There might be merchants who are using this space as a location away, to have more hushed conversations in a less public environment. You have arrived. What would you like to do? I look up into the rafters and see if Professor Thaddeus came home.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Animal Handling,"think I would see Professor Thaddeus, but I did not roll that. I rolled a ten. You do not see Professor Thaddeus in the rafters. Too bad, man. That would have been really cool, huh? It would have been so cool. He flew the coop. Shame on you. That was bad. I don't feel good about that. I go running upstairs. I am sad-- there's a little part of me that, when you first got that owl and you made your","first animal handling check, I was hoping you"
Perception,"and I'm happy to have you home."" Thank you. What time is it about now? At this point, it's later afternoon. I'd say you probably have about another hour or so before dusk. I don't think we should look at the tower. Let's go fucking break into it right now. Let's go right now! I don't think we should do that. I used up three spells already. So what? We'll be fine! There's nothing in there. We're just going to steal some stuff. Can I make out, from the spine or the cover, what book she was reading that she set down?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"If anything, you're mocking her. She leaps off her stool and vanishes behind the counter. You hear the footsteps walk away and go into a back chamber, and you're left alone on the floor in the room for a second. Whoa. Do we see anything cool? Anything interesting on the wall? There's all sorts of interesting. Decorative scabbards containing what you assume to be a blade decorating the walls, you can see large conch shells and various sea trophies that were taken from people making the journey all across the Swavain Islands. Anything shiny?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Persuasion,"Oh yeah. A few moments pass. The door opens up again and he has a tiny leather journal and he, ""All right, soonest that we've got here--"" pulls it back, ""The soonest we've got here-- let's see, ""about 17 months, three weeks, and four days."" Is it possible to maybe move that up into a very quick emergency meeting? ""What's the emergency?"" We have to leave town and will not back for quite a while. Yeah. ""Well, come back in a number of months--"" It's time sensitive. We could all be dead.","MATT: Make a persuasion check. Actually, no, make"
Deception,"opens up again and he has a tiny leather journal and he, ""All right, soonest that we've got here--"" pulls it back, ""The soonest we've got here-- let's see, ""about 17 months, three weeks, and four days.""

""Well, come back in a number of months--"" It's time sensitive. We could all be dead. Make a persuasion check. Actually, no, make",a deception check because this is--
Persuasion,"We were hoping for an audience if you have time this morning? ""You just happened to approach and knock for an audience?"" We came by yesterday, and we were told it might be best to come back in the morning. We brought tea. ""Did you make an appointment with Wensfeld?"" Yes, he said to come back in the morning. It's an emergency. We have really good tea! Earl Grey!",MATT: Both of you make persuasion checks.
Perception,"present me with this dangerous information."" Don't you want our tea, though? We might not want to shout it in the streets, up to you! ""You don't have to shout it."" You notice that his voice is a whisper, even though he's 30 feet away from you. We feel a bit exposed, I would admit. ""You're safe."" There's some sort of amplification to his voice and it's placing it omnipresent around you at this low volume, like he's right there. Can we tell from where we are if he's human or elven, or--?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Persuasion,"people in the corner when it is time. ""Then what do you hope to gain from my alliance?"" Information, for the moment. ""About?"" About the things in our possession, powers that we are tapping into, the people we may come across. ""And eventually what favors would you be asking?"" We all know corruption runs rampant in both the Empire and the Clovis Concord. I don't want anything to do with that. I just want the truth.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Deception,"definitively lowered because it was something that you had existing paperwork as an example of handwriting on, so upon passing through, you present your paperwork and the guard there gives you a look. ""All right. You are returning to Alfield, what is your business in Nicodranas?"" Yes, we were getting his new pet. They're very rare apparently, or something, hmm. ""Okay, and you are returning to the Empire? You're not staying in the Empire."" We are returning to the Empire. ""All right, and whom do you pray to?"" To... To the old platinum dragon of course! Just like everybody else!",MATT: (laughing) Make a deception check.
Animal Handling,"Oh yeah. It's to ward off bandits, makes it a little easier to-- Feel free though, it's just an illusion on the cart. ""Let them through."" They go ahead and wave you though. The high-rolling paperwork helped you. Ooh! All right. Now, the open blue skies of the coast give to the winter gray of the Marrow Valley. You have four days to Trostenwald. Is there anything you wish to do in that four day period, or no? I'm going to try to teach Nugget. You know, just work on that whole bamfing in and out and staying with us.",MATT: Make an animal handling check.
Investigation,"You get some more supplies for the next leg of your journey, if you'd like to. To get you to Alfield, we'll say, amongst the whole crew, maybe-- let's see here... We still can create food and water. If you want to create food and water, then you don't have to pay for anything. All right, cool. You travel-- this would be two days. Is Gustav still in the town, or has he left town? Just out of idle curiosity. You want to ask around? Just while we're there. Okay, while you're there, go ahead",and make an investigation check.
Perception,"at a distance, while it looks like the source of this blue flash, a male figure, is standing where previously was not. Oh shit, okay. This figure that apparates is wearing deep blue robes and appears to be elven, with very long white hair. Also an elder elf, though of pale skin in comparison to the one you met previously. Approaches with haste towards this woman. They begin to whisper for a moment before he shoos off the rest of the guards, and the two of them begin to walk together, the pair of them having a conversation. Caleb? I don't recognize either?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"of their former life. Stop the cart. (neighing) Is anyone around? You can see there is a crownsguard-- a pair of crownsguard that are walking this way. I'll cast Disguise Self and be some gnomish old lady. I'm going to walk over to the burned-down apothecary and start looking around. For anything in particular, or just trying to make it look like you're looking around? I'm looking for identifying signs of life or--",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"gnomish old lady. I'm going to walk over to the burned-down apothecary and start looking around. For anything in particular, or just trying to make it look like you're looking around? I'm looking for identifying signs of life or-- Make a perception check. 15. You glance around, looking through the visible rubble, moving a few things. Don't appear to be any signs of life, nor any signs of death, immediately. Can I look for buttons?",MATT: Make an investigation check
Investigation,"Where are the nearest guards at this moment? The ones that you were just speaking to. They walked off? They're walking off now. I'm going to hop out of the cart, go over to Nott, and trip. Fall face flat into the dirt. Wipe dirt on my face and into my beard, stand up, and pull my hood up. I'm going to help Nott search through the rubble. Yes, I'm going to start searching through the rubble. Same.",MATT: Let's make an investigation check
Investigation,"Do you open the basement? Mm-hmm. Stepping down the stairs underneath, it's a small chamber, no more than 15 by 15 feet. The room is tossed, not like you remember. There's a pile of broken table shards in the far right corner. There's additional shattered glass all over the floor here. There's an iron chest, roughly three feet long by a foot wide, that sits in the far left corner. A single chair holds the center of the room. That's what remains inside. Lighting it up in here. Does it look like there was a struggle in here, or it's been turned by someone looking for something?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"That's way worse. Yours is much better. I go up, and can I touch and see if there's an invisible person in the chair? There is not an invisible person. I really appreciate that. I was a little spooked. That's the Mighty Nein special. Nott. You clearly have some personal attachment to this. I'm going to sit in the chair and see what I see. What does it look like from the chair? It looks like the room. She's Will Graham-ing it. You're tearing me apart.","MATT: Based on your investigation check,"
Investigation,"She's Will Graham-ing it. You're tearing me apart. Based on your investigation check, you gather that the chair was probably placed here after this, whatever transpired in this room. What would someone want from here? I don't know. Is there another way out of here? Chemicals. There was chemicals here. He kept chemicals. Second set of stairs into the house? There is no other exit from this chamber. No hidden ones, nothing?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"Who has it? I will gladly carry it. My brain's not working. The Iron Shepherds, with Lorenzo. Oh, that's right. I think we should try and lock everything up and maybe break the chair. Why should we break the chair? Can I actually do a little pass on the chair and see if I see any signs that someone's been tied to it, someone's been questioned? How was it locked from the outside? Things that Beau would know that people would do in her realm?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"I will lead them to a spot on the river bank that I know. All right. Moving past the handful of people in the city that are noticing this strange band of adventurers that have wandered through, you make your way past the outskirts and you can see the river itself cruising right along. It would be a beautiful landscape if there wasn't this intensity of emotion and the distant haze of long-grayed smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the partially burned farmlands. Nevertheless, Nott leads you over towards one of the shaded banks under a few trees and you come to a stop. Are we being followed?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"than a year. Year and a half? I don't know. Not exactly. It's all sort of a blur. I feel like we can get this fixed. We're here now. We can do something. We just have to take some time, think carefully and slowly. I don't think we have time. He's gone. They could be killing him now, these people that have him. Do we know who we think that is? Is it the people you know? Is anyone else-- Is there anyone coming? Do we hear anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"It's nothing. So, shall we ride around a bit? Yes, because I want to hear what Caleb has to say. I also want to get a sense of things, so we're going to take a lazy meander around the area. I want to get a sense of where things are, get a map in my head, and I'm going to be paying very close attention. Through the city? No, on the outskirts. Okay. It'll take you a while. I'm going to keep going around until they...","MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for me,"
Deception,"a hundred or so feet away. Keeping an eye out? ""Yeah."" Could you see anything that was driving them off or were they just taking their sweet time as they left? At this point the other, first guard you were talking to goes, ""Hey, what's your ""business here, anyway?"" We've come across these cricks before. We saw them in Zadash. There was a big ruckus in the middle of the city. Trying to learn all we can. I don't know when we'll come across them next. I feel like share and share alike, you know?",MATT: Make a deception check.
Survival,"probably descends to a depth of about 50 or 60 feet below and continues at a steady decline on for about another-- as you continue to walk, continuing to walk, you get to a full close to 200 feet in before it comes to an ending point. There's a few carts at the base carrying dirt and rock up. You can see shovels and pickaxes and all sorts of materials that have been left behind by the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel. There's no marking on it? This is an obviously organically-carved tunnel? Looks to be, yeah. The footprints going in and out, there's nothing--",MATT: Make a survival check.
Perception,"ground and due to the nature of this cavern you're in, it echoes pretty loudly in this space. You all can gently feel it and the guards in the back start looking around a bit nervous, not quite sure what's happening. One of them runs off afraid. He's like, ""It's going to collapse!"" I'm picturing like a didgeridoo. (low rumbling noises) You've run it for awhile, you've cast the vibration into the rock. What are you going to do to try and listen for? Honestly? I'm going to try and see and cut it off to see if there's an echo coming through the rocks, basically, in that split second.",MATT: Make a perception check.
History,"What? Ghor Dranas. Xhorhas. (whispering) What? (whispering) Something Dranas. Ghor Dranas. That's all I have. We've heard that before. That's in Xhorhas. Yeah. It's in here. Yes, it's in there. The cricks took him. Does that mean he's alive? Probably. Thank you, Caduceus. Citadel! They have a citadel. Seems silly to move someone who isn't. Anyone here who's proficient in history,","make a history check, if you don't mind."
Perception,"Then I walk off. Okay. He makes his way back. You've hired some crownsguards under the table to keep an eye and escort Edith and Luke over to Alfield to meet with Bryce, where they're going to take care of them to some degree. Okay, so what do we do? Yes, what do you do? Do we go in the tunnels? Do you want to go in the tunnels? Okay. Well, I imagine the same guards will be out there again. Are we just going to plunge on in and try to-- Do we see any of the elven folk of the two that we have been talking about while we're walking around?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Sleight of Hand,"to be a little quick thing and he was going to be like, ""For brevity's sake,"" like he does, but he didn't. Sure. Nope, this is a full scene. I just want pockets. ""So just the two?"" Sure. ""Let's say, eight silver?"" Done. ""All right, there you go."" Passes it over. Okay, let's go. Let's head to the tunnel and if that doesn't pan out, we'll start heading north. I rearrange some things on the shelves as she's doing that.",MATT: Make a sleight of hand check for me.
Deception,"were here and we were hoping we could toss you a little bit of coin and, you know, check out this area here a bit. We pinged something in the center cave and we just needed to reconvene before we came back to take a look at it. ""And by whose guidance are you assigned to do this?"" Cobalt Soul. Beauregard. Been taking notes. From Zadash. ""They've signed authority?"" Yeah, it's called this belt and these vestiges on my fucking body. Shit.","MATT: ""You make a deception check, you make an"

Athletics,"You watch as the guards take a step back, like, ""Uh..."" It's all normal down here, how are you? I turn back and I go (giggle). How long does that last? It lasts for an hour? Yeah. Can I talk in Polymorph? No, I'm straight up that thing. No, you are a dire honey badger. (honey badger sounds) Dig! I'm digging! That's what I'm doing! That's just-- that's what this-- (snarling) All right, I will say-- go ahead and make an","athletics check for me, adding what would be the"
Athletics,"Do I get another level four at level eight? I don't know. I'm going to go check right now for you. Oh my god. I'm going to start tapping on the walls of that tunnel-- Well, no. That tunnel's really thin. If we can-- At level eight, you get a second 4th-level slot. I have another 4th-level spell, you guys. I can do it again! Do it again! Okay. (deep breath) (boosh) Back into your dire honey badger form. And Bless!",MATT: Go ahead and make another athletics check.
Perception,"You carve through, and you reach the other side of this collapsed tunnel. And we all instantly die. Yeah, right? As the molten l-- No, I'm kidding. No! No. Minecraft! We've all made this mistake, Taliesin. No! Pick, pick, pick, argh! Granite, granite! As soon as I make a hole I'll turn back into myself and peek through.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"the chamber. And it is a chamber. What you've stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern. About 30 or 40 feet ahead of you it drops off, and looks to be about a ten-foot drop before it hits another straightaway. As it curves to the left, you've already smelled the minerals and the hard water smell of the interior of this chamber. You glance over to the side and let the orbs drift over a little further, and you can see a river. It's an underground river, and it seems to have carved its way through this lower portion of the chamber. It vanishes further below into-- As a point, can I tell if we're walking into any bullshit?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Deception,"Yes. As you're doing this, the one guard is, ""Oh hey, uh--"" Yeah. We've just gotten access to a small pocket that we're just going to check out, make sure everything's safe and appropriate. We'll have a full report once we've finished taking a look inside and we'll be delivering it. But in the meantime, let's not cause any undue panic. We'll let you know, or we'll make some noise if anything dangerous is down there. It still could not be safe. You're welcome to come, but I'm not sure if it's going to be-- I can't guarantee any safety beyond this point.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Nature,"Crazy like a badger! (badger noises) I'm into it. So you guys make your way through the tunnel and join Caleb. Mm-hmm. As you all step into the interior, you can also take in that smell of long-sealed underground water, hearing the rushing of the small river. You can see where the path continues on, and with the dim glow and the darkvision, where it curves forward you can see a faint natural arch that looks to be a continuation of the tunnel. Out of curiosity, those crystals feel utterly natural, right? It just feels like those were not--",MATT: Make a nature check.
Perception,"I'm thinking about Detect-- Nah. I could draw one! Fuck yes. Just before we move on, is anyone bothered by these crystals? Is this-- Are they creepy? Do you hear anything? Do you see any kind of traps left behind? I'm a little out of my element, which is surprising to say. Traps? On the ceiling? Sure, I'll look for traps. The people could put them on the ground or anywhere.",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Don't apologize. It's okay, we're figuring this out. Will Nugget fit by Yasha? Okay, yeah, if you would like to have taken your-- Where else will I put him, you know? I don't know, maybe outside of the tunnel? Back at the place where we were? Where would they stay? I don't have the mini on me at the moment. I can do that at the break. However, as you've worked out your grouping, traveling through these tunnels, you go on for an hour, two hours. Those at the front, which would be you two, I'd","like you both to make a perception check, please."
Survival,"these tunnels, but within them, it doesn't look, from anything you've seen so far is lived in. You don't see signs of any other creatures making homes or nests. You do see bits of quartz-like crystal forming from gathered minerals over time. I really like it. Yeah, it's pretty. A series of stalactites and stalagmites that find their way through the-- see? Thank you guys, for your help. T. Top. Yes. Just keep giving me suggestions. Really figured it out. It's not condescending at all. Are there footprints on the ground?",MATT: Make a survival check.

While we're walking.",MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.
Perception,"I'm going to cast Light behind the crystal. It's a beautiful prism. As you see, the entire room is a scattering of shades of purple, pink, and, strangely, orange. It refracts the light in a way you haven't seen before, and for the moment, this dark ominous space becomes this beautiful disco. I couldn't help myself. Magical things live here, I bet.

There are small bits, maybe like two- or three-feet pockets, but a large portion of this little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal.

Frumpkin does notice throughout the evening some movement a strange creature, similar to what seemed to be the stalagmite-type roper creatures who you had fought before, but a little smaller, scooting along the ceiling. It made it through the tunnel, over top of you guys, and then continued on without noticing or caring about the location where you had placed and camouflaged your evening's rest. The next morning comes to. You continue traveling? All right. Keeping a watch out, Laura, please, as Jester, roll your",perception check. It's a long subterranean journey

Perception,"a little bit of this tunnel structure. That one came into this one, though. After the big guy came through. What? That's funny, that was exactly what was about to happen. I'm sorry, what?

Do I hear anything? Do I see any scrapings that would give a sign?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"I'm going to clear away a little bit more. Is there a body underneath this pile? No body. Just a hammer? Yeah, just like a discarded tool. I'll take a look at the hammer. It's a hammer. It looks like it's seen a lot of use. Why? Why a hammer? The metal's wrecked a little bit in places and it's been bludgeoned and misused. I think someone got grabbed. Are the rocks around here dug out, like someone was digging?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"following this, is it going to lead us-- There's no way to know. Yeah, no, I know. I was just kind of throwing it out there. How far can Frumpkin go? Actually, that's a good idea.

You have no idea what the other giant's doing, but this one is across the way and is visible from your position. They think there are more kobolds coming. How are we going to get out of here? And where are we? Do we see into the chamber, across on the other side? It's not a chamber  it's huge, right? It looks, you would guess, probably a hundred or more feet across to the other side, but there is a wall there.",Make a perception check.
Perception,"Yeah, we'll get back to that. In a map? Should we mark this on the map then, with a pin? I was speaking in metaphor. Oh yeah, I like those. What do we do? We can sneak in. We can create a diversion. We could create a diversion. Hold on, let me see what kind of spells I have taken. But then to what end? We're going to run in there and do what? How far from the opening of the tunnel that we're at, off to the left, are both of the fire giants?",MATT: Make a perception check for me
History,"would be better if, you know, I could Dimension Door with you, Caleb, over to the other side. And? And then we just keep going. We never engage with these fucks. Wait, what about us? What about the rest of us? You're just going to leave us? Well, he's going to make a big distraction and then we all run. I have a sneaking suspicion that there's probably-- These giants are fast, faster than we are. Probably with some range. Would I know anything about giants, reading up on them or anything?",MATT: Go ahead and roll a history check for me.

Nugget's just going to run out and he's going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can. He's going to be fine. Yeah. He's going to be fine. I'm also going to add resistance to you so you can add a d4 to any saving throw for the next 60 seconds.",LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks.

I believe if you're moving your full speed it's disadvantage on stealth? I'm trying to remember. But with Blessing of the Trickster it might be balanced out, because you get advantage on-- If you have disadvantage and advantage it just cancels out, no matter how much you have of each. So it would be just a straight roll. I'll put it there. That's fine.",So go ahead and make a stealth check.
Stealth,"You just barely maintain concentration. That was the base DC. You maintain? Yeah, she's still invisible. 15, 20, 25. You still have ten more feet of movement there. Under the bridge. Okay. And-- (pained screaming) I'm coming for you, Spurt! You're under the bridge now. And then I will press my body to the bridge and bonus action just hide. Go for it. Go ahead and make a",stealth check.

And then I'm going to make her run out and leap over the lava and land on the other side. As it is an illusory duplicate, it does not need to make a check. It just appears to leap and land. And then she's going to act like she's readying for the fight and getting ready to cast something. Okay. I will say, make",a deception check.
Athletics,"Okay. You can do it. You can. You run across. (burning) Not right at the giant. I'll go around in a-- Can you leap on the crumbled bridge parts? Sure, I'll try to leap on some rocks.

(licking) Jams it back in his mouth and begins chewing on it again. Can I make the staff look like it's made of snakes or something? Can I Thaumaturgy? Unfortunately, that's an illusion spell. Thaumaturgy is very simple. It's a very faint effect that wouldn't have an effect if they weren't already tripping balls. If they're already tripping can we say: Whoa, why are you holding that snake in your hand?",MATT: Make a persuasion check!

You see he's putting his tongue through his mouth and bits of teeth are falling out of his lips and bouncing off of his belly.

And the deep secret is: You know that I am you. He releases you and takes a step back and goes. (sobbing) And starts sobbing openly. The two other troggs clap the side of his shoulders and start sobbing, too. The three of them sit in place and start having the most basic of existential crises you could watch.

Stealth,"What if they're waiting to explode the middle? And we're standing here talking in this chamber. Could I take some of my ball bearings and go across? I have my ball bearings in my pocket to trip them, and go across and try to get closer. You could throw them out in front of you to try and see if it hits them. No, I'll have them with me in case I need them as a defense. Can I sneak across to see them? Okay. So you pull out your small pouch of ball bearings, hold them in your hand.

There are a few pieces of equipment that have lasted okay, although covered in black soot. There's a couple of small satchels that are left there and looks like they were back to back. Just hoping for help or trying to find a way off, and eventually, they expired. I'm sorry you had a tragic ending. I'm going to keep flying around them.

I will say that door comes right off the hinges. Even though I rolled a two. To hit it? You rolled a two to hit it? I did. It's plus six, so that's eight? In that case, the door comes right off the hinges, clatters down onto the ground, and you're now standing on top of it. I rush in. I see if there's anyone that I can help, anyone who's still alive.",LIAM: Make an investigation check.

How come none of us ever used a tower in this game? I don't know, but it looks so cool. Now I want one. 18. What did I just say, perception? Investigation. My perception is way better. They seem like they have been dead a while.","In fact, follow that up with a medicine check."
Investigation,"150 feet away, but there is a cart full of vegetables, half unloaded. You can't tell quite what they are from here. I yell to the others what I see on the inside. And I wait. Don't go any further. Wait until we come up with some kind of plan or something, man. It's a cart full of vegetables. What kind of plan do you need? Our father might be in danger. We must move quickly. Does it look like the bodies were dragged into the temple, or does it look like they were murdered inside the temple?",LIAM: Make an investigation check.
Medicine,"I'll pick up a mace and I'll run to the cart on the way. I will say, also as you're running in, you look at it. This mace looks old. As you run up to the cart, you see instant recognition from your youth, from your teen years. One of the farmers that tills the land on Castle Lorelei's grounds is shot full of crossbow bolts, as is his 15-year-old son. They're leaning against each other. It's a cart full of turnips, apples, some cabbage. It looks like someone has started to unload it. Although, it does not look like it pulled up. It looks helter-skelter. They're long dead?",LIAM: Make a medicine check.
Investigation,"goes (creaking). Nice job, human weapon. In here, in the great hall, it's not much, but there clearly has been a fire in the hearth here that is burning down to embers. There is dim light in the grand entryway to your keep. To your home. The first thing that strikes you is a small wooden table and three chairs pulled into the center of the room. There is a smattering of playing cards thrown out across the table. Dad? I walk up the table and swipe up the playing cards. Try to sniff them. See if I smell anybody that we recognize.",LIAM: Make an investigation check at

Your Aunt Kat's room is upstairs. Your father's room, your father's study is upstairs. We've got to go upstairs. You want to be the tip of the spear this time, Larry? Oh, I'm the tip of the spear, you're the human weapon? I'm walking up the stairs. I look around the room. Is there any tracks in the room? Anybody that looks like they might still be hiding in the room?","LIAM: Oh. Yeah, okay. Make a perception check."

While she's doing that, can I ask Aurra if she smells Father in any particular direction? 12. I'm sensing sarcasm from you, brother. I was being genuine! There is a very nice carpet under that table and in front of that fire. You do see wet prints pressed. Wet prints! What does that mean? What? Lucius is ascending the stairs. Would you",make a perception check at advantage?
Perception,"You honestly do smell your father. It's not strange for any of you, but especially you. You spend so much time in the woods, not in your human form. And that smell is coming from upstairs. We must proceed upstairs. The smell is getting stronger. I mean, he lives here. Of course you're going to smell him here. Benicio, for christ's sake. Did you say there's a print? Yes. Fresh print from the rain. Human? Human boots. I look up the stairs. I listen as well.",LIAM: Sure. Make a new perception check.
Investigation,"Portia! You gave up your right when you took up the fucking woods! I mastered The Taming! I stayed at the house! But where is your wisdom?! It's right here! This is mine. I earned this. If you're going to be petty about it, you can have it. Thanks. Where is Father? Is there gore behind the desk, on the walls? Does it look like he was (gagging) killed here or just the hand brought in later?",LIAM: Make an investigation check.
Investigation,"here? Why did they not take it? Agreed. Why is this place not turned upside down? Why is everyone dead, but only one person was in here? Didn't Father-- Did he have a brother? No. He was an only child. Raised by his aunt. Katerine. I run to Aunt Katerine's room. Yeah, okay. You run down the halls. The door on the end, to the left coming up the stairs. Are you going in? Okay. Bust the door open. She has one of those old four-poster beds. It is clear that a scuffle has happened in here. The bed is askew, and there are shredded claw marks in the",bedding.

Do I believe him?",LIAM: Make an insight check.
History,"I'm not sure if you heard me the first time. Well, sometimes it helps me if I think of the first letter. Should we go down to the crypts, should we try to rescue Father? Yes. Is there anything inside the spike? It was just the blade that they found. Oh, I do share with the blade to the both of them. The smell is familiar. Does anyone else recognize it? Do we recognize it?",LIAM: Make a history check.

I hang back a healthy distance while I can still see them because I'm not good at dexterous-- Well how far back are we saying? 15, 20, 30 feet. Whatever is comfortable.

Right now, you guys do not see much, you're just standing at the back of the building. There's no door or windows? Not back here, no. You know it's on the other side. The exact opposite side of where you are. Let's go around. Do I hear movement?",LIAM: Make a perception check.
Perception,"No. If this were the building right here and I'm you guys initially coming around the side, you would see the light reflecting off of things over there. So it's here, but out of view. There is light directly in front of the building that we cannot see the source. That you can't see the source, right. Flame light? It looks like it, the light is shifting, yeah. Listen.

She's petrified, and there's just a moment of silence between the two of you as you huff in her face, and you can hear the wind now, moaning low against the walls of the castle in the distance, and through the trees behind you.

You see what you remember as being a very smooth wall of stone ruptured with rubble lying around, and it's not wide, but a crack leading through. This is something you have never seen before. So a dead end no longer. Correct. Whoa. I figured as much. Our road does not end here. Blood on the floor? Any signs of struggle?",LIAM: Make an investigation check.

Insight,"some point, what lays beyond this Cask of Amontillado-type wall. But it quickly gives way to natural formations, opening into a substantial chamber ahead. It's a cave, and there are two torches at the far end of it, flickering. The cave bisects though, not that far in front of you, and it seems to split. As it opens up, there is a passage on your right. But your eyes are more drawn, very obviously, very clearly, to the far end, where those torches burn.

Stealth,"it. I'm Marcus, and my question is to Matt. I've noticed a lot of 18s and 19s failing recently while in, where they are. I'm trying to keep spoilers out. Is that due to levels scaling, or is it due to where they are? It's due to the scaling of the entities that they're working with, and the situation involved. A DC can be set based on how difficult the challenge is. You know, if a person's like, I'm trying to stealth in a shadowy alleyway, that's going to be a pretty low DC, but if I'm going to try and stealth while standing on top of this lighthouse in broad daylight, it'll probably have",a higher DC to roll a proper stealth check.

They're all having fun, I'm having fun, but-- Your hourglass thing that you do every now and then is just the meanest thing on earth. There's always that. The chess clock. Putting a timer and giving people a very limited period of time to succeed or decide is always fun. Doing the initiative order ahead of time is great.

At the intersection, there are two crownsguard that are stationed there that are keeping eyes and watching around. Off to the eastern side of that intersection, behind one of the poles that contain the lanterns that are lit at night, you can see the cover that leads into the sewer below. It's less of a sewer or manhole cover, but there's an open drain, and a latch and a small metal pole that prevents anyone from going into it. Are there any clowns in it?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"been an issue. So you get yourself down, and it's no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this at the moment. You see from this spot where you've climbed down, the ceiling drops low to about ten or so feet. You're probably about 15 or 20 feet below the surface now. I'll take out my torch. I'll light my torch once I get down there. Your torch lights and the bright space begins to open up from side to side. (yells) Do you see any monsters down there? I look around. (yells back) Everything looks good!",MATT: Make a perception check.
Investigation,"I keep looking. Keeping watch. Listening. You all eventually down into the sewer grate and then you hear the (metal scraping) (click) and the metal bar up top is closed. He locked us in! No, he just closed it, Jester. It's a trap, we're all going to die. We won't die. What do we think? Go up or down? Up, right? I think a monster would be down. Monsters are down. Can I do a look around to see if there are any types of street marking for the sewers?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Perception,"Everything's going to be fine, Jester. Shh. Don't spoil it! You guys begin to head southward. It's a very faint decline. You can only tell it's a decline in the sense that if you look right or left you can see the water is trickling in the direction you're traveling. The tunnel continues for about 100 feet or so before it curves slightly to the right and then comes to another set of rungs and another sewer-top access.

Or it could be somebody that's being slowly sucked dry of all their blood. You're totally right. Should we set it on fire, or should we see if it's living? I think we should try to cut it down in case it's a person. Is it wiggling at all?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Okay, but it's not familiar to me? I mean, it's webbing. There are many creatures in nature that use webbing in different forms and types. Like YouTubers. Yes, there's that too. Glancing at this, the mass that is encased in the webbing is about this big. It's a dog. It's about dog-sized. Or a rat. Is it close enough to us? It's about 20 feet ahead of you.

The webbing burns away, it's not enough to catch the bodies on fire, though it does singe and burn the exterior and as you look they're both in various states of decay. The skin you can see, as you approach a little bit, Yasha, to take a look, the cheeks within their helmeted heads are sunken and sallow. The lips are curled back over the teeth. They are drained of any internal life force or blood. Can I poke around with the tip of my sword and see if there's any money or something in their pockets?",MATT: Make an investigation check.
Medicine,"I'll take them. Okay, you being to pull from their bodies, what are the rest of you guys doing? We could take their weapons, I bet they're nice weapons. Or we could return them to the Crownsguard, maybe they would reward us? Do they have a dog tag? Glancing about as you inspect the bodies, there's no identifying tag to them. There isn't an elaborate system of maintaining Crownsguard members or identifying that you've noticed at least. Can I search for puncture marks? Stab wounds? Bite marks?",MATT: Make a medicine check.
Medicine,"Sure, easy enough to do. What about their weapons? Do they have any? They do. They both are carrying a longsword. They're well kept, not used. You look along the blade and there are barely any signs of indentation. Does it say anywhere ""Property of the Crownsguard?"" No, but they are uniform design. They're not elaborate or ornamental. The Crownsguard weaponry are all pretty much designed or provided by a similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel like they're uniform to a certain degree.",TRAVIS: Ten on the medicine check.
Perception,"Ten on the medicine check. That's enough. It's not too hard to see. As you look over each of the two bodies, both of them have heavy puncture marks, either right in the back of the neck on one of them, or the other one has it right under the front of the chin. The puncture marks are about that wide, about two inches across on each side where the skin and flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side and they go very deep in. So big fangs. Probably fucking pincers. You know (clicking). Yeah. So watch your shit. Caleb stands still for a second and looks around. Do I hear anything?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"some sort of webbing layer around it and all the walls are covered in it. Across the way you can see rungs and the end of this portion of the drainage that leads up into where you can see the wind would be coming through, and that faint bit of wind that's pushing through that's causing all the webs to shift is coming from what you can barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset light peeking through another exit. A sewage exit just like the one that you came in. You also see a number of other figures that are all webbed to the walls and encased within there. All of the ones webbed to the walls are just as emaciated and dead?",MATT: Make a perception check.
Perception,"Okay. You stay there with the halfling. I might be able to negotiate my way a little further. Is Jester right up with the halfling? No, I'm 20 feet away from it.

Athletics,"You can go first. Is there a way I can hop over the web situation? Is it bothering you? Yes! It's been bothering you this whole time? It was bothering me this whole time, too! I meant to fix it in the break. Laura Bailey, the kind of friend that tells you when you have a booger in your nose. I really appreciate it. Can I jump this gap where Molly is and avoid the webbing? You can certainly try. Go ahead and make an","athletics check. You are standing in webbing, so"
Stealth,"attack. Yeah. (counting) 14. Plus Fury of the Small, 17 points. (cheering) As it opens its mouth, the firelight from the torch flickering in, its horrible weirdly shaped spider-like mutated mouth open up where the pincers and the giant fangs are. A bolt sinks into its throat, and it starts shrieking, backing up defensively, the pain causing it to pull away from you. That's a serious amount of damage. Yeah. I scramble away in Caleb's direction, and that cocoon guy there. I'm going to hide right behind him.",MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.
Insight,"You're safe now! ""Oh god! (panicked breathing)."" He starts looking around, looking up at the faint bit of light now, which it's now just passing sunset. You see a little bit of purple light coming through, and through the little bits of webbing, you can see the grate that leads outside. He goes, ""I don't know how I got here."" You don't know how you got down here? You didn't come to the sewer on your own? ""Well I-- Yeah, I guess."" What were you doing down here? ""Well, I was just trying to get somewhere quickly.""",MARISHA: Insight check.
Insight,"""Oh god! (panicked breathing)."" He starts looking around, looking up at the faint bit of light now, which it's now just passing sunset.

You don't know how you got down here? You didn't come to the sewer on your own? ""Well I-- Yeah, I guess."" What were you doing down here? ""Well, I was just trying to get somewhere quickly."" Insight check.",MATT: Make an insight check. You see flames
Investigation,"Before we do that, what's your name, friend? ""Thed."" Ted? ""Thed."" Thed. I thought he said ""dead"". Thed is dead, baby. Thed, where is the key? Which pocket is it in? ""I'll be happy to show you once you cut me free."" I can start digging. I start digging through his pockets.",MATT: Make an investigation check. At a closer
Insight,"I didn't take anything from his pockets. That's what he's saying. (gasp) I just want something in return. You know, you provide a service, get something in return, right? ""What-- if I can be of service, I'd be happy to."" Who's the Gentleman? Ooh. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Oh, friend. I heard ""Gentleman."" I'm walking over. Oh friend, I don't need to roll an",insight check to know that's bullshit.
Persuasion,"Ooh. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Oh, friend. I heard ""Gentleman."" I'm walking over. Oh friend, I don't need to roll an insight check to know that's bullshit. ""I apologize, I don't-- I apologize. I don't know what you're talking about."" Wait, was was it? Who's the Gentleman. I'm going to get closer to Thed and say in Thieves' Cant-- Yes! You can trust us. We're one of you.",MATT: Make a persuasion check.
Investigation,"Anything else interesting in the room, outside of the bodies? Outside of the bodies? It looks like there is broken bits of what would have been furniture or a cart at some time that got discarded or shoved down here from above. Other than that, just the general refuse you've come across down here in the sewer. We do have a spider body to pick. Can I happen to see-- am I able to see the guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff? Yeah, you see him. Oh, cool. Do I recognize any of the names of ships, or any imagery?",MATT: Make an investigation check on that.
Investigation,"(laughter) (sings) Continuity. Roll for continuity. Beau turns to Nott. Hey girl. Yeah. That little code you were talking. (clicks tongue) See any of that written around these walls, or something that looks similar to it? I can look around. Thieves' Cant is a written or spoken thing? Both. It's almost universally spoken, and as a language it's used for extended ciphers. Make an",investigation check.
Insight,"wall. There is a very, very faint scratch into it that says, although not referring directly to yours, it says ""Money pot."" Money pot? Yes. (whispers) Money pot? (louder) It says, ""Money pot!"" Which catches you off-guard, because you're like, ""That's one of our--"" That's one of our one-shots! What, what? That's one of our things, but that's not-- it can't-- it's not us. We weren't down here before, were we?",TRAVIS: Insight check.
Deception,"advice from when it comes to administrating my people."" Don't punch him, don't, no. No, he's got a fair point. I'll give him that. You don't look like an administrator, I mean, that's actually almost a compliment. You know, yeah, it's fair. ""I'm impressed, I will go ahead and retrieve your payments to the Mighty Seven."" Nein. We lost two in the sewers. (laughter) ""I'm sorry to hear that, that's terrible."" Extra pay would soften the blow.",MATT: Make a deception check.
Stealth,"I was under the assumption that you had to be de Rolo level to have a bath in your house. In your house. They have one washroom for the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has, and the water is changed every few hours, maybe. That's what I'm saying. But it's functional. That's why we should have gone to Pumat Sol's. That's why people have bathhouses, to clean up. When Fjord's taking a bath, I'm going to go through his stuff and try to find his letter. His letter? The letter for the Solstryce Academy.",MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Perception,"clean up. When Fjord's taking a bath, I'm going to go through his stuff and try to find his letter. His letter? The letter for the Solstryce Academy. Okay. Go ahead and make a stealth check. Not good. 15. 15? Would you have taken your stuff in with you? Or would I still be in the room? Molly would probably still be in the room. I got to stealth past Molly, or get him out of the room.","MATT: You do. Make a perception check, Molly."
